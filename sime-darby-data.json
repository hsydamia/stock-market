Contentious talks between the United States and Canada ended on Friday, with no deal to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) after the mood soured, while U.S. President Donald Trump signalled his intent to sign a bilateral trade pact with Mexico. Talks are set to resume on Wednesday, with the aim of reaching a deal all three nations can sign. \"The chance of a reduction in tensions on this (NAFTA) front has lessened, while we also know Europe is readying to hit back, if President Trump imposes tariffs on cars and goes after the bloc\", said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at Sydney-based AxiTrader. \"And then we have China, pushed into a corner and unlikely to be able to do a deal\".

For many Malaysians, the surprise victory of Pakatan Harapan, led by Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, in the 14th general election has ushered in a new era of hope. In conjunction with the country\u2019s 61st Independence Day celebrations, we asked property experts and industry players three questions: What is your wish for Malaysia Baru? What are the three most important issues facing the property industry? Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why? Read on for their replies. See Kok Loong\nDirector, Metro Homes Sdn Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nMy wish is that the new government will focus on safety, education and healthcare. We need concrete steps to reduce crime and make Malaysia one of the safest countries to live in. We need to ensure that the standard of public education is close to the world standard so the next generation can help the country progress further. There is also a need put aside politics in education and focus on ensuring that all Malaysians get high quality education. The government should also ensure high-quality healthcare for all citizens. The first parliamentary session assured us that institutional reforms will be carried out. I hope the leaders are prudent in ensuring that we have a good balance of development progress and reduction of government debt. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nAffordable housing is the most important issue currently. There is a need to ensure that every eligible Malaysian can afford to buy a home. The government should have proper planning for each development to make sure there is real demand so that there will be no mismatch. Oversupply might be disastrous for the economy. The government should also ensure proper enforcement so as to avoid having abandoned projects. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nKL Railway Station and Railway Administration Building are my favourite buildings. The former was built in 1910 and the latter, 1917, by British colonial architects. Both are well maintained. I still remember taking the train to Singapore from here in the 1980s. The KL Railway Station has witnessed the progress of KL. Although most people take public transport at KL Sentral now, the old station remains a beautiful piece of history and architecture. \u00a0 Eddy Wong\nManaging director, Nawawi Tie Leung What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nWith the change in government, we are starting a new chapter, full of hope and anticipation.\nI wish for the country to be united as one, where we are all Malaysians, regardless of race, language or religion. Where we can live in harmony without fear or favour, where the rule of law applies equally to everyone. Where good governance is not a privilege but is to be expected from our leaders, and meritocracy is our guiding principle for decisions and policies.\nWe need to be relevant and competitive in the global arena. This is the only way to ensure an exciting and prosperous future for each and every one of us. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nAffordable housing, high household debt and the oversupply situation in the residential, office and retail market sectors. To resolve the affordable housing issue, we must not only look at the supply and the facilitation of the development of affordable homes, but also the demand by raising the income levels of the population. In order to raise income levels, we must review the quality of education in the country. Education should not be politicised; only by equipping the population with the right skills and knowledge through education, and with improved productivity, can we raise income levels and achieve the home ownership dreams of our rakyat. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nI grew up in Johor Baru and one historic building that stands out is Bangunan Sultan Ibrahim on Bukit Timbalan. The former State Secretariat building\u2019s design and architecture reflects a combination of Johor Malay, Islamic and colonial influences, which not only gives it its uniqueness but also a majestic aura. It is certainly an iconic landmark in Johor Baru. \u00a0 James Wong\nDirector, VPC Alliance (KL) Sdn Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nI would like the government to come up with a national housing policy so that every person will have a home, an integrated and affordable public transport system for every city and major town and a greener environment with the planting of more trees, reducing the use of plastic and cutting pollution. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nWe need to build more affordable housing to cater for demand, address the mismatch between supply, demand, location and property pricing by increasing supply in the right property sectors and building more homes in areas where there is demand. We also should reduce property prices by having clearer planning guidelines, reducing red tape and implementing the Industrialised Building System. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nKellie\u2019s Castle in Batu Gajah, Perak, stands out for me. Built in 1915, the six-storey English castle with Scottish, Moorish and Indian architecture was to have a lift and a basement cellar. Scottish planter William Kellie Smith built the castle to persuade his wife, Agnes, to live in Malaya but unfortunately, he died before he could finish it, in 1926. \u00a0 Lim Poh Yit\nDeputy group managing director, Titijaya Land Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nI wish for a government that places importance on its people. Racial harmony and high religious tolerance should be a priority moving forward. Only then can the country progress and make an impact on the world stage. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nThe loan rejection rate is currently very high, so, many people cannot afford to purchase a property of their own. The gap between affordable homes and buyers\u2019 expectations is also an issue; low-cost housing should not necessarily compromise on quality. Lastly, the process of buying homes is too tedious \u2014 a qualified buyer has to deal with various agencies. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nPanggung Bandaraya DBKL in Kuala Lumpur. Besides its beautiful architecture, it also plays a significant role in promoting Malaysia\u2019s performing arts and culture industry. These historic buildings need to be preserved for their long and rich cultural heritage. \u00a0 Sarena Cheah\nManaging director, property division, Sunway Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nMy wish is for all of us to do our part, learning from our past successes and failures, in starting a new chapter to strengthen our country\u2019s foundation for a more progressive and sustainable future. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nThere is a need for all stakeholders to work together to develop a holistic and coherent strategy in addressing the mismatch between the demand and supply of homes for all Malaysians.\nIt is also crucial that we have a clear plan to improve the country\u2019s overall productivity and income growth to support a more robust market economy while working on initiatives to help all Malaysians own their first home. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nThe Sultan Abdul Samad Building, which faces Merdeka Square, is a prominent landmark where the nation declared its independence on Aug 31, 1957. It continues to be a popular destination for all Malaysians and serves as a beautiful reminder of the past and brings people of different ethnicities together for one unified purpose. \u00a0 Samuel Tan\nExecutive director, KGV International Property Consultants (Johor) Sdn Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nI wish for Malaysians to live harmoniously. Each person should be given an equal opportunity to prosper in this nation. Policies implemented must benefit the people. Corruption must be erased and the culprits must be caught and punished. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nThe three pressing issues are oversupply, affordability and balanced development. Oversupply of certain property types causes an imbalance in the ecosystem, which is unhealthy. Affordability is the availability of houses that are within the purchasing power of buyers. Increasingly, houses are getting out of reach of the average man on the street. Balanced development means ensuring growth is spread to other areas apart from the growth corridors. There will be opportunities for all to enjoy the fruits of economic growth. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nIn Johor, Bangunan Bukit Timbalan is an outstanding historic building that embraces the rich past of the state. It was used as the State Administrative Centre as well as the command centre during the Japanese occupation. It is a very visible landmark that can be seen from Singapore and its unique design showcases the rich Johor architecture. \u00a0 Sarkunan Subramaniam\nManaging director, Knight Frank Malaysia What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nMy wish is for Malaysia to be a harmonious and racially tolerant country that practises transparency and accountability. Moving forward, politicians should argue with merit. Also, I wish May 9 could be declared Liberation Day because we were truly liberated by people power. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nFirst is housing affordability. Owning a house gives people a greater sense of security. Second, improving the country\u2019s economy. This can be done by bringing foreign investors into the high-end residential and big-ticket investment markets. Lastly, cutting red tape in land development and reducing compliance costs. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nBok House in Jalan Ampang, Kuala Lumpur. The building is gone but it is vividly clear in my memory. It was a beautiful building that featured classical European architecture. Also, the widely believed love story behind this mansion amazes me. \u00a0 Datuk Ewe Swee Kheng\nDeputy executive chairman & group managing director, Ewein Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nIt is uplifting to see that the new government has brought the people so much hope and spirit. I hope that it will deliver on its promises and create new policies that can improve the property market. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nSlow income growth versus demand for affordable housing has been an issue for many years now. Despite more developers venturing into the affordable housing segment, many of the new generation of buyers are still adopting a wait-and-see approach. The term \u2018affordable housing\u2019 also needs to be looked into more deeply and redefined, if necessary. As so many of the houses in this category are being introduced and marketed, it may create unrealistic expectations among consumers, which leads to lower buying interest as well as higher loan rejection rates. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nWithout a doubt, Fort Cornwallis on Penang Island is my favourite. It has a long and interesting history. Built in 1786, the fort has never been engaged in combat and has now become a prime tourist attraction. \u00a0 Datuk Christopher Boyd\nExecutive chairman, Savills Malaysia What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nMalaysia needs much more job-generating investment. Nothwithstanding the change in government, potential investors, both domestic and foreign, need to feel confident that Malaysia is embarking on a long period of political stability. That is my wish for Malaysia Baru. Stability, investment (particularly foreign direct investment) and prosperity. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nMalaysia has no major property problems. Oversupply in some sectors will right itself in time. However, I would like to see: \u00a0Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nMy favourite historic place is Merdeka Square. Overlooked by Bukit Aman and bounded by the Sultan Abdul Samad Building, the Royal Selangor Club, St Mary\u2019s Cathedral and what was once one of Malaysia\u2019s earlier banks, it is a living history book. It tells the story of the city\u2019s colonial rule, hardship, floods, fires, wars and eventual independence and prosperity. \u00a0 Ngan Chee Meng\nCEO and managing director, Gamuda Land What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nAn inclusive Malaysia and a transparent and effective government. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nThe government\u2019s role in rolling out affordable homes, as property affordability is largely associated with social inequality. Better connectivity so that developments can expand into suburbs and people can still commute to the city with ease. A good transport infrastructure will reduce the cost of living for people who choose to live in the suburbs instead of the city. Everyone deserves equal access to a greener living environment and the government should promote this for all development projects. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nTo me, it will always be the Sultan Abdul Samad Building opposite Dataran Merdeka. It is an iconic and beautiful heritage landmark that all Malaysians can relate to. \u00a0 Previndran Singhe\nCEO, Zerin Properties What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nA Malaysia for all Malaysians. An improved education system, talented Malaysians who are nurtured to reach new heights, good morals. Respect for one another, humility and kindness to be the pillars of future generations. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nThe property industry has the normal issues experienced in those of other countries. We hope Malaysia Baru can pave the way for a sustainable property industry, with a strong focus on the rakyat. This, plus proper structure and local plans, will give a quality lifestyle to all Malaysians. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nThe 121-year-old Bangunan Sultan Abdul Samad! Its sheer Indo-Saracenic beauty, its history and its location at the confluence of the Gombak and Klang rivers truly take you back to the pre-independence era. It was at one time the biggest building in Malaya. The country was governed from here! \u00a0 Billy Ong\nGroup managing director, OCR Group Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nI hope Malaysia will move forward from the old chapter and start building a stronger Malaysia Baru to improve living standards and shine again in the region. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nThey are affordability, supply of affordable housing and economic uncertainties. The development costs, which include land, construction and compliance, have increased tremendously over the years. This has been the main hurdle for developers to price their products competitively. The affordability gap has become wider as income growth has slowed. Over the years, there have been good efforts on the part of certain government agencies to increase the supply of affordable housing. However, more effort should be put into studying the income and demographic profile of households in particular locations before any project is launched. Economic uncertainties also affect the overall demand in the property market. Purchasers are more sensible in making decisions in the current market, so property developers must ensure that they launch the right properties to meet the demand. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nI do not have a favourite historical building, but I think it is important to preserve such buildings because of their historical and cultural value. \u00a0 Edward Chong\nManaging director, IJM Land Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nMy wish is for all Malaysians to stay positive, embrace the future with confidence, live together in peace and harmony and have access to a quality home. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nAffordable housing is an important issue that needs to be addressed by multiple stakeholders such as government agencies, policymakers, financiers, utility providers and developers. They need to work together to enable more Malaysians to own a home. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nThe iconic Petronas Twin Towers has been a towering beacon of architectural innovation for the last 22 years and serves to seed progressive forward thinking on city planning and development. It draws global attention to Malaysia and the growth of the nation as it marches towards developed country status. \u00a0 Datuk Tan Hong Lai\nManaging director and CEO, Green Target Group Sdn Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nAs a Malaysian, I wish that we can value and appreciate each other. I look forward to seeing all Malaysians realising the importance of each other in building the nation and creating Malaysia Baru. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nThe government and private sector should work together to provide better housing schemes for the public. The foreign workers policy should be looked at to smooth out construction activities. Also, developers are facing hefty compliance costs such as utilities contributions and other authorities\u2019 requirements. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nMy favourite historic building is the Stadthuys, or the \u201cRed House\u201d, in Melaka. Built in 1650, it is the oldest Dutch building that is still standing in the East. The fact that it is still standing strong shows the quality of the workmanship back then. \u00a0 Datuk Zamani Kasim\nCEO, Astaka Padu Sdn Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nImproved racial integration and an enhanced Malaysian identity. We need to create stricter laws to punish those who make racially charged comments, especially politicians. The government should rationalise the development objectives of the country for the rakyat, especially the poor, and low and middle-income, rather than showing strong economic indicators whose benefits are not realised by the rakyat. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nThe government should promote sustainable development and caring for the environment to benefit the current and future rakyat. Corruption needs to be wiped out completely. The education system needs to be reviewed to create well-balanced individuals. Review the approach to and implementation of affordable housing. Singapore\u2019s Housing Development Board is a proven example. Business and economic development targets should be further enhanced. Tracking of implementation needs to be improved to ensure that targets are met and jobs are created to meet current and future demand. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nThe Malay traditional home is my favourite. It is green, adapts to the climate and culture, and is aesthetically pleasing. Ezumi Harzani Ismail\nPresident, Pertubuhan Akitek Malaysia (PAM) What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nTo end corruption. We should focus on improving financial management and contract procurement, and curbing abuse of power by local authorities. These are the areas that are always prone to corruption.\nThere is also a need to reinvest in good education and reinstate the budget for higher education that was previously cut.\n\u00a0What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nOver-regulation in the housing industry is limiting its growth. And there is a mismatch between demand and supply of lower and mid-range properties. Restrictive financial rulings limit property ownership. Tighten rules over other types of spending, but not on purchase of property. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nThe Sultan Abdul Samad Building opposite Dataran Merdeka in Kuala Lumpur. The icon was fully restored to its original condition by me and my team at Arkitek MAA Sdn Bhd in 2008. Built in 1897, it was a government office before becoming a courthouse. \u00a0 Datuk Sri Amrin Awaluddin\nGroup managing director, Sime Darby Property What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nSime Darby Property hopes to contribute towards building a great nation that can punch above its weight globally. We are a country with great potential and our diverse communities must come together for nation building. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nAffordable housing for first-time homebuyers, unsold stock and the rising cost of doing business. Sime Darby Property will ensure that our products are offered at the right time with the right price, given the soft market. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nIt is the iconic Stadthuys building in Melaka. It has evergreen architecture and is solidly built. It is still standing although it was built more than 360 years ago. Stadthuys is the oldest remaining Dutch colonial building in Asia. It has a rich past that blends well with Melaka\u2019s local culture and historic attractions. The building also brings back good memories of my childhood spent in Melaka. \u00a0 Foo Gee Jen\nManaging director, CBRE I WTW What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nLet\u2019s stop shooting ourselves in the foot. It\u2019s time for a paradigm shift from affirmative policies to meritocracy, and to develop and provide fair opportunities for all Malaysians. Our education system should impart skills, inspire ingenuity and cultivate values of love and acceptance. Education is a necessity that needs to be enhanced. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nHouse unaffordability could lead to social illnesses. This requires multi-level commitment to streamline actions, reduce red tape and compliance, and elevate incomes. Gazette local and structure plans for transparent practices, revisit the town planning Act and requirements for sustainable development. Lastly, improve the efficiency of the public transport system. Make it more accessible and affordable. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nAfter 61 years, Malaysia is renewing its aspiration to embrace diversity. Kampung Kling Mosque, Cheng Hoon Teng Temple and Sri Poyyatha Vinayagar Moorthi Temple \u2014 all located within a stone\u2019s throw of each other in Jalan Tokong, Melaka \u2014 reflect our embodiment of diversity 300 years ago, long before we called ourselves Malaysians. \u00a0 Tang Chee Meng\nCOO, Henry Butcher (M) Sdn Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nIt is my wish that, learning from the mistakes and shortcomings of the previous administration, the new government will be able to get the country back on track to become a developed and progressive nation based on policies that are transparent, equitable, non-discriminatory and people-centric. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nThe three issues are providing every Malaysian with accommodation that is not necessarily based on the ownership model, relaxing lending guidelines but ensuring that the household debt ratio is still manageable and ensuring that projects are not overburdened by excessive costs to keep prices in check. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nMy favourite is the Moorish-styled Sultan Abdul Samad building. It is an iconic and historic landmark in Kuala Lumpur and a popular tourist attraction, especially since it is located opposite the Tudor-style Selangor Club and Dataran Merdeka. \u00a0 Michael Geh\nPresident, FiABCI Malaysian Chapter What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nWe should emphasise doing things right from the outset. What we have been doing all this while is very wrong and there is a need to change mindsets. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nLowering all costs in the delivery of affordable housing is vital, as is making available loans for affordable housing. Our building construction system has remained the same over the last decade and we need to have modern construction systems such as IBS (industrial building system) and BIM (building information system) in place for better efficiency in building management. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nBangunan Sultan Abdul Samad, which is most visible during parades and is widely televised. \u00a0 Sulaiman Saheh\nHead of research, Rahim & Co What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nWith a vision of attaining a more liveable and happier all-inclusive-Malaysia, I wish for a more equitable, sustainable and transparent system that is adaptive and proactive to the needs of the people. Moreover, build and improve on the existing system rather than \u201cscratch & build new\u201d for better resource-efficiency, with firmer practice and enforcement on ground. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nFirst, there is a disparity between disposable incomes and new launch prices, which leads to larger numbers of unsold properties. Second, we need a better and more reliable central database system that is publicly accessible to enable all stakeholders to make more prudent and informed decisions. We need to unify the affordable-home agencies under one roof. And we need to empower and encourage more urban regeneration and renewal, enabled by a new \u2018collective sale\u2019 mechanism. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nA\u2019Famosa in Melaka is a reminder of how we can lose our own country and how the people fought to earn back our autonomy (although it was subsequently taken over by the Dutch, and only four centuries later did we regain independence). Today, we need to remind ourselves that neo-colonialism is still an ongoing threat that has now manifested in non-physical ways. \u00a0 Datuk Lai Voon Hon\nGroup managing director, Ireka Corp Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nMy wish for Malaysia Baru is to regain our status as one of the most progressive and advanced countries in Southeast Asia. Malaysia Baru should strive to not only be advanced in terms of technology and business but also in social, political and cultural development. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nAffordable housing for all Malaysians. There is a need for a comprehensive review of all delivery processes, including land and planning approvals, high charges by utilities companies for residential projects and government funds for maintenance of low-income housing. We should introduce modern planning guidelines for assisted, independent and senior living. We should promote Malaysian My Second Home more. We should promote Malaysia as a regional hub and head office for multinational corporations through incentives and trade promotions so that we can increase the take-up rate of high-end apartments, offices and hotels in city centres. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nOne of my favourite historic buildings is the old Kuala Lumpur Railway Station. It used to showcase the importance of Kuala Lumpur as the largest railway hub in Malaya. I hope the railway station can soon be restored to its former glory as a modern transport hub and hotel, much like King\u2019s Cross St Pancras in London. \u00a0 Anwar Syahrin Abdul Ajib\nManaging director and CEO, UEM Sunrise Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nA robust and thriving economy spells a brighter future for everyone. My hope is for the government to propel the economy by proactively encouraging and creating policies that attract foreign direct investments and promote local enterprises to prosper internally and externally. We need policies that promote long-term sustainable growth \u2014 and these policies must be equitable and inclusive. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nThere is a mismatch between new housing supply and household demand and affordability. In addition, there are multiple agencies dealing with, and providing, affordable housing. A one-stop agency would be most efficient and effective. I see the need to streamline processes to reduce compliance costs. There is also a lack of transparency and availability of up-to-date and reliable market data. An integrated database of market supply and demand indicators would help developers and financiers make more informed decisions. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nThe Kuala Lumpur Railway Station, a Mughal-influenced building, is classic in style yet intricate in detailing. This building brings back memories of my schooldays when I had to travel between Kuala Lumpur and Kuala Kangsar. It was a time of mixed emotions. It was hard to leave my family but at the same time, I was also looking forward to being with my friends. I can still remember being dropped off at the station and walking through the building to the platform to take the Ekspres Sinaran Pagi back to Kuala Kangsar. \u00a0 Datuk Soam Heng Choon\nPresident, Real Estate and Housing Developers\u2019 Association Malaysia What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nOur wish is for Malaysia Baru to be a nation that has dignity and respect. We wish for fair and inclusive policies that will safeguard the unity of the people with diverse backgrounds, cultures, races and religions. No parties should be marginalised and everyone should be taken care of from both the economic and social aspects. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nFirst is the increasing cost of doing business, which is affecting house prices for the rakyat. The government should look into ways to address this issue in order to assist the rakyat in owning homes.\nSecond is homebuyers\u2019 ability to secure end-financing. This is especially so for first-time purchasers. Third is affordable housing, which is encumbered by various issues such as cross subsidisation, lack of comprehensive data and distribution and resale of subsidised housing. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nThe Kuala Lumpur Railway Station. Built more than a century ago, it was the main railway station connecting the north and south. Today, it still serves as an important hub for commuters in Kuala Lumpur. It has a fascinating architecture that combined both east and west elements. The beautiful architecture is one of the main factors that it is recognised as an iconic building, attracting tourists from all over the world. \u00a0 Tan Sri Leong Hoy Kum\nGroup managing director, Mah Sing Group Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nMalaysia is a country that was built on unity, regardless of race, creed and culture. History has proven that as a united nation, we can achieve great things. I hope the rakyat will continue to stand together to build an even better Malaysia for all the generations to come. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nAffordability should be redefined. Also, there is still a big demand-supply gap in Malaysia with more than 120,000 new households formed each year, compared to 88,000 new houses completed each year, from 2012 to 2017. To revive the sluggish market,\u00a0 we suggest the following: \u00a0 Chen King Hoaw\nManaging director, LandServe Sdn Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nI wish to see a progressive government that truly cares for every single person who contributes to nation building. I wish that everyone, regardless of race and religion, will work and live together in harmony, making Malaysia a great multiracial nation. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nThe three issues are the property overhang, escalated and unaffordable property prices, and lack of coordination among numerous approving authorities and agencies, which continues to contribute to the overhang and mismatch between location, property type and pricing.

Hence, it did not come as a surprise when it was reported a few weeks ago that Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Azmin Ali said the government had decided to present a white paper on FELDA at the next parliament session \u201cto expose the true situation of FELDA and [draw up] strategic rehabilitation plans.\u201d \u201cThe immediate focus of the new FELDA board and management is to rehabilitate FELDA\u2019s cash flow through discussions with its creditors to restructure loans amounting to RM8.02 billion,\u201d Azmin was quoted as saying in the local press. Most agree the agency should not have much of an issue in restructuring its debt. To recap, the agency\u2019s listing about five years ago of its unit FGV Holdings Bhd, in which it holds a 33.67% stake, was expected to bring it big gains. FGV\u2019s stock was floated at end-June 2012 and by the following week, on July 4, it hit a peak of RM4.66, giving it a market capitalisation of more than RM17 billion. Felda\u2019s stake was then worth RM5.72 billion. Today, FGV\u2019s market capitalisation is RM5.95 billion, down almost RM11 billion from its peak, which means FELDA\u2019s block of shares is now worth just slightly above RM2 billion \u2014 a decline of about 65%. FGV is required to pay RM250 million annually to its parent FELDA for 20 years as part of a land lease agreement. This is on top of a payment of 15% of operating profit from the sale of fresh fruit bunches from the land leased from FELDA. To date, FGV has paid as much as RM1.5 billion to its parent since its flotation in 2012, and has not missed any payment. However, with FGV facing problems such as low efficiency, mature plantations and issues with foreign workers, it has not been able to pay dividends lately. For FY2012, FGV paid a dividend at 14 sen, followed by 16 sen in 2013, 10 sen in FY2014 and four sen in FY2015, but could only manage one sen in FY2016. For FY2017, an interim dividend of five sen was paid but no final dividend was recommended. FELDA\u2019s 33.67% stake, or 1.23 billion shares, in FGV means that in FY2017 (stet) it received RM61.5 million in dividends, compared with RM196.8 million in FY2013. And this year also did not start off well for FGV. For its first three months of FY2018 ended March, it registered a net profit of RM1.33 million from RM3.6 billion in revenue. So, dividend payments for the current year are uncertain. The ties between FGV and FELDA run deep. FGV\u2019s annual report states there is a loan due to a significant shareholder, which is FELDA, amounting to RM1.39 billion as at end-December 2017. However, FGV also has RM222.66 million due from FELDA, according to its annual report. It is understood that although the RM1.39 billion debt is not yet due, FGV may settle a portion of it soon. While FELDA\u2019s shareholding in FGV may be its biggest shareholding, it holds various stakes in other companies as well. \u00a0 Small stakes in various companies FELDA\u2019s shareholding in several publicly traded companies is worth billions in total.A random check shows it has investments worth about RM3.28 billion in various companies listed on Bursa Malaysia. However, the shares are largely pledged. Among others, the agency has a 4.23% stake, or 45 million shares, in Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd (KLK), which on Aug 15\u2019s close of RM24.80, is worth RM1.12 billion. These shares are pledged with Maybank Nominees (Tempatan) Sdn Bhd and ABB Nominee (Tempatan) Sdn Bhd, a unit of Affin Bank Bhd. FELDA also has 17 million shares, or 4.23%, in Batu Kawan Bhd \u2014 the parent company of KLK. The shareholding is worth RM295.12 million, based on the counter\u2019s close last on Aug 15 of RM17.36. These shares are also pledged with Maybank Nominees and ABB Nominee. The agency has a 0.69% stake, or 47 million shares in Sime Darby Bhd worth RM121.73 million. These shares are pledged with Maybank. Following a demerger exercise, former plantation giant Sime Darby now houses the heavy equipment, motor and other businesses, while Sime Darby Plantations Bhd and Sime Darby Properties Bhd control the plantations and property development businesses respectively. Checks on Bloomberg reveal that FELDA has no equity in these two units. FELDA also has a 0.55% stake, or 8.82 million shares, in Boustead Plantations Bhd worth RM11.2 million, based on the counter\u2019s close of RM1.27 on Aug 15. In TH Plantations Bhd, FELDA has 700,000 shares or a 0.08% stake, in TH Plantations Bhd, valued at RM507,500. Apart from these plantation companies, the agency has a 1.09% stake, or 117.81 million shares in Malayan Banking Bhd, worth about RM1.15 billion, based on its close of RM9.79 on Aug 15. These shares are pledged with CIMB Group Nominees (Tempatan) Sdn Bhd. In shipping giant MISC Bhd, FELDA has a 2.07% stake, or 92.61 million shares, valued at RM562.14 million based on MISC\u2019s close of RM6.07 on Aug 15. The shares are pledged to Maybank and ABB. Apart from that, the agency has 10.3% or 44.42 million shares in Nextgreen Global Bhd (formerly BHS Global Bhd), valued at RM17.43 million. The counter closed at 37 sen on Aug 15. Via wholly owned Felda Investment Corp Sdn Bhd (FIC), FELDA holds 14.60% or 360.81 million shares in Iris (worth RM55.92 million based on its closing price of 15.5 sen on Aug 15), and 67.13% or 197.07 million shares in Encorp (worth RM98.53 million at on Aug 15 close of 50 sen). While the actual size of FELDA asset base is unclear, there could be some hidden gems. In February last year, former FELDA chairman Tan Sri Shahrir Abdul Samad clarified that contrary to speculation, the agency did not lose RM4.3 billion from the RM6 billion raised from FGV\u2019s flotation. According to him, RM1.44 billion was invested in property \u2014 RM304 million in Bukit Katil, Melaka; RM86 million Grand Borneo Hotel in Sabah; RM500 million on Grand Plaza Serviced Apartments in Bayswater, London; RM225 million on the Institut Penilaian Negara (Inspen) building; and RM110 million on Iris Corp. Some of these assets, in particular the Grand Plaza Serviced Apartments, could be worth significant sums now. \u201cFELDA has pockets of land all over the place, so there should be no problem restructuring RM8 billion of debt,\u201d a person familiar with the agency says. \u201cThe agency was established to eradicate poverty, and to a certain extent it has been successful, but FELDA settlers these days are not like before. They seem to have special rights, and are even averse to carrying out replanting themselves. This is because they are seen as a vote bank and accorded special privileges. Things have to change,\u201d he sums up. \u00a0"}, "4": {"date_posted": "27/8/2018", "title": "The Week Ahead: US-China tensions, SST, earnings in focus", "article": " US-China trade tensions will continue to be in focus in Malaysia this holiday-shortened week, while further news flow on the Sales and Services Tax (SST) \u2014 such as what goods and services might be exempted from it \u2014 is expected ahead of its implementation on Sept 1. The stock market will close Friday for the National Day holiday. A slew of financial results for the April-June quarter will be out this week as public listed companies rush to meet the end-August release deadline. Investors remain concerned about the trade war between the US and China after mid-level officials from both sides ended two days of trade talks last Thursday without any breakthrough. This means that their months-long spat, which has roiled global markets, is not likely to end anytime soon. On the same day, the US imposed a 25% tariff rate on US$16 billion of Chinese goods, a move that Beijing immediately reciprocated with its own 25% tariff on a list of US goods on the same scale. The world\u2019s two largest economies have now slapped tariffs on each other on a combined US$100 billion worth of products since early July, and more are in the pipeline, raising concerns about their impact on global economic growth. At home, the Dewan Negara passed five Bills last Monday that allows for the SST to be implemented on Sept 1, as planned. Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng has said that 5,443 goods and services will be exempted from the SST compared with 545 under the previous Goods and Services Tax. The SST rate has been set at 10% for sales and 6% for services. Meanwhile, all eyes will be on the progress of the government\u2019s hunt for fugitive businessman Low Taek Jho (Jho Low), after Malaysian police filed the first set of criminal charges against him and his father, Tan Sri Low Hock Peng, last Friday over money allegedly stolen from 1Malaysia Development Bhd. The action will pave the way for the next move, which is to seek an extradition of the two men from wherever they are now hiding, theedgemarkets reported that day, citing legal sources. Under Malaysian law, the trial of those accused of a crime cannot proceed unless they appear in the dock for the court to take a plea. On Thursday, Bank Negara Malaysia is expected to provide a detailed disclosure of its international reserves as at end-July. Over in China, industrial profits data for July will be out on Monday. On Friday, its official manufacturing and non-manufacturing Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index data for August will be out. Factory activity in July was slightly lower than expected, with the PMI at 51.2 compared with a Reuters forecast of 51.3 based on a poll of economists. (A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a reading below that signals contraction.) Other important data out in Asia on Friday include India\u2019s second quarter gross domestic product, Thailand\u2019s July trade and South Korea\u2019s July industrial production. The Bank of Korea is the only major Asian central bank with a monetary policy decision this week. It is widely expected to keep its policy rate unchanged at 1.5% on Friday.

On Aug 28, there is data on July trade and on preliminary wholesale inventories, while on Aug 29, there is the second estimate of the country\u2019s second-quarter economic growth. According to a previous \u201cadvance\u201d estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the US economy grew 4.1% year on year in the second quarter, its fastest pace in almost four years. There will likely be further news flow on the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\u2019s annual economic symposium last week at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell was to have delivered a speech on Friday.

The main drag for those involved in oil palm cultivation was none other than lower crude palm oil (CPO) price, an analyst with Public Investment Bank Bhd (PIVB), Chong Hoe Leong, told The Edge Financial Daily over the telephone. \u201cIf there was one key factor that affected most of their performances in the first half (1H), it would be the CPO price, which has come down quite sharply by easily 15% to 20% on a year-on-year comparison,\u201d he said. CPO price averaged RM2,700 last year, but has since fallen to around the RM2,300-and-below level. However, Chong is keeping his earnings forecasts and target prices of stocks under his coverage for the remainder of the year, despite the rather bleak CPO price outlook now based on current levels. \u201cI believe earnings will be better in 2H, which is normally when seasonal production is higher, making up for the losses registered in 1H,\u201d he said, adding that oil palms seasonally contribute about 60% in 2H to full-year production. At last Friday\u2019s close, the benchmark palm oil third-month contract for November delivery settled unchanged at RM2,219 per tonne. Brent crude oil, meanwhile, stood at US$75.58 (RM310.63) per barrel at the time of writing. Alan Lim of MIDF Amanah Investment Bank Bhd also expects earnings to improve slightly moving forward, given recent price trends of the CPO and Brent crude oil. \u201cCPO has been trading at a very marginal premium, or a slight discount, to Brent, when it has always been much higher in the past few years. This suggests that the CPO price has bottomed and should not fall further, unless Brent sinks significantly. \u201cAs long as Brent stays between US$70 and US$75 per barrel for an extended period of time, it limits the downside of CPO price to RM2,200,\u201d he said. Typically, higher palm production or volume translates into poorer CPO prices. But in a case where prices are expected to be largely unchanged, the higher production may actually set the tone for better earnings for palm oil players. \u201cThis is because it then makes economic sense for countries such as Indonesia to increase biodiesel production to absorb the excess palm, while at the same time save some US dollars for the country by buying less petroleum,\u201d he said. \u00a0 Earnings outlook less cloudy for integrated, downstream players The lower prices of CPO and palm kernal would look better in the books of integrated players, who are also involved in the downstream sector, an analyst who declined to be named told The Edge Financial Daily when contacted. \u201cIntegrated players can find shelter in the downstream segment due to the lower raw material prices and higher crude oil prices, which will result in improved competitiveness against synthetic products. \u201cFor example, Sime Darby Plantation Bhd has been trying to beef up their downstream business segment by focusing more on differentiated products, which carry higher margins and better prices when compared with bulk products,\u201d the analyst said. Chong of PIVB named Ta Ann Holdings Bhd as a top performer among stocks under the research firm\u2019s coverage in the plantation sector, given the company\u2019s exposure in timber. The stock, which closed seven sen or 2.57% higher at RM2.79 last Friday, received an \u201coutperform\u201d call with a target price of RM3.19. According to Ta Ann\u2019s 2017 annual report, its timber products business segment, which contributed to about 35% of the group\u2019s full-year revenue, recorded a loss of RM10.26 million, hit by a drop in production volume. \u201cWe are hopeful the company\u2019s earnings will catch up substantially in 2H after it received the certification for its Kapit Forest Management Unit on June 11, 2018, which should significantly bump up its log production soon,\u201d Chong wrote in last Friday\u2019s note."}, "6": {"date_posted": "7/8/2018", "title": "KLCI seen trending sideways, immediate support at 1,764 ", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 7): The FBM KLCI is seen trending sideways today with immediate support at 1,764, despite the firmer overnight close at most global markets, as buying support at the local bourse is likely to be lukewarm.

AllianceDBS Research in its evening edition Monday said despite last Friday\u2019s up close, the FBM KLCI had on Aug 6 formed an inside day bar as market participants decided not to stage an immediate follow through buying pressure. It said in the absence of stronger buying or selling interest, the benchmark index was moving between the green and red zones throughout the trading sessions before settling at 1,779.75 (down 0.34 points or 0.02%). \u201cIn the broader market, losers outnumbered gainers with 514 stocks ending lower and 333 stocks finishing higher. That gave a market breadth of 0.64 indicating the bears were in better control,\u201d it said. AllianceDBS Research said the inside day bar indicated a pause in the game play with both buyers and sellers seen in a balanced position. It said a buying attempt with an opening level above the last Friday\u2019s settlement was initiated on the opening bell, but the benchmark index did not go far up. \u201cThis can be seen from the day\u2019s high of 1,782.19. Over the past 21 days, the market has registered a total of 18 up closes and only 3 down closes. \u201cSo, the lower high on Aug 6 was not a surprise since the market has not undergone a meaningful and healthy correction after the recent rise of 126 points in 18 days (measuring from the high of 1,788 on Aug 1 to the low of 1,662 on July 9). \u201cMoreover, many market participants were also fearful of a sudden market turnaround as the present market level is not viewed a quality trading opportunity in term of risk and reward profile,\u201d it said. The research house said following the down close on Aug 6, there should be selling attempt with immediate support at 1,764.\u00a0 \u201cThe analysis of overall market action on Aug 6 revealed that buying power was weaker than selling pressure. \u201cAs such, the FBM KLCI would likely trade below the 1,777.78 level on Aug 7,\u201d said AllianceDBS Research.

The statement was issued in response to reports quoting PKR de facto leader Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim that the Battersea Power Station deal and other major \u201cdubious\u201d property investments in the UK will be investigated by the new Malaysian government. On Tuesday, shares in S P Setia and Sime Darby Property took a beating following Anwar\u2019s statements.

PNB holds majority stakes in S P Setia and Sime Darby Property, which jointly own 80% of the equity in the Battersea Power Station project. The EPF directly owns the remaining 20% stake in the project. PNB and the EPF signed a heads of terms on Jan 18 this year with Battersea Phase 2 Holding Company Ltd, the joint-venture company tasked with developing the power station, to initiate preliminary negotiations to purchase the commercial assets. \u201cAs previously assured by all parties, the decision to explore the potential reorganisation of ownership is purely an investment consideration initiated by the Battersea Power Station\u2019s board and management team, together with the EPF and PNB,\u201d said S P Setia and Sime Darby Property, adding that they are of the view that the transaction will enable them to continue to reallocate capital to other areas of their development businesses. \u201cPNB and the EPF view this as a strategic opportunity to secure ownership of a unique and iconic real estate asset, which will be able to deliver sustainable income streams into the future to meet their respective income needs,\u201d they added. They said the transaction is expected to generate an attractive long-term yield for investors, and the transaction has been extended to June 29, 2018. \u201cThe parties are continuing to work positively and constructively together towards completing the proposed transaction and a further announcement will be made in due course,\u201d they added. The two property developers also provided updates such as work on the power station building itself is progressing well, and that it is scheduled to open to the public in late 2020, with some 40 million people expected to visit the power station annually when it opens. The power station building will house 120 shops and restaurants, an event space and visitor attractions, as well as 253 residential apartments, which are currently 90% sold. Its approximately 1.8 million sq ft of space will include 500,000 sq ft of offices which have been pre-let to Apple Inc, they said, adding that it is one of London\u2019s largest-ever office pre-lets.

The site acquisition and subsequent costs of the power station development have been fully funded by a combination of equity from shareholders, together with development debt provided on commercial terms by a mixed group of nine Malaysian and international lenders \u2014 of which more than 60% have been provided by international lenders, they said. \u201cThe \u00a3458 million development loan for Phase 1 has been fully repaid ahead of schedule.

At 3.34pm, the stock was trading at RM5.40, still up 17 sen or 3.25% from its last closing price of RM5.23. A total of 1.51 million shares were exchanged so far, valuing it at a market capitalisation of RM37.07 billion. Official data released today by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) showed Malaysia's palm oil inventory declining 0.51% to 2.17 million tonnes in May 2018, from 2.18 million tonnes in April, as production declined in Peninsular Malaysia, and Sabah offset gains in Sarawak. A decline in stockpile generally lends near-term support to crude palm oil (CPO) prices, as a lower inventory is a reflection of demand exceeding supply. However, monthly CPO production for the month declined 2.1% to 1.53 million tonnes, from 1.56 million tonnes in April, according to MPOB. Owner of online published Palm Oil Analytics, Sathia Varqa, said the production fall in May was \"expected but unseasonable\", as this would be the first fall in the month of May since 1995. \"The production fall is seen as temporary but will only partly dissipate in June. We expect to see modest production rise in June, given lingering [effects] of Ramadan and Eid festive holidays,\" he added.

Corporate earnings have been rather disappointing for the first quarter of 2018, with most companies missing expectations. Their performance is the main factor that drives the market. The unexciting corporate results will not augur well for the local bourse, at least in the next few months, amid a lack of fresh catalysts. The numbers were down across most sectors, with only the banking sector seeing good performance in terms of profit growth. The improved earnings by the banks were due to lower provisions for non-performing loans. Malayan Banking Bhd achieved 9.7% year-on-year growth in its net profit to RM1.87 billion in the first quarter ended March 31. Revenue rose 2.1% to RM11.52 billion. Maybank attributed the improvement to higher net interest income and Islamic banking income. Hong Leong Bank Bhd saw a 21.2% y-o-y jump in net profit to RM690.03 million in its third financial quarter ended March 31, 2018 (3QFY2018), on higher net income, lower allowance for impairment losses on loans, advances and financing, and higher share of profit from an associated company. The banks aside, corporate earnings were generally down, says Inter-Pacific Securities research head Pong Teng Siew. \u201cIt was disappointing and I might even say that it was bad across the board. I would estimate that only 7% to 8% of the companies listed on Bursa Malaysia posted bottom-line growth in the first quarter,\u201d he tells The Edge. Export-oriented counters such as furniture makers generally saw a decline in their net profits in the absence of foreign exchange gain as a result of a stronger ringgit against the US dollar. Lii Hen Industries Bhd saw its net profit drop 63.2% y-o-y to RM8.13 million in the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 (1QFY2018), while Latitude Tree Holdings Bhd\u2019s net profit plunged 79.2% y-o-y to RM2.4 million. The stronger ringgit also had an adverse effect on plantation counter Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd, which saw its net profit fall 34.6% y-o-y to RM189.27 million in the second financial quarter ended March 31, 2018 (2QFY2018). Meanwhile, Felda Global Ventures Bhd\u2019s 1QFY2018 net profit declined 21.9% y-o-y to RM1.33 million. The drop in earnings was attributed to a lower average crude palm oil price of RM2,472 per tonne compared with RM3,061 in 2017. Other notable companies that missed forecasts include Axiata Group Bhd, which reported a net loss of RM147.41 million, versus a net profit of RM239.02 million in the previous year, due to a higher share of losses from its Indian associate Idea Cellular Ltd. CIMB Investment Bank has downgraded the counter to a \u201chold\u201d with a lower target price of RM5. It expects the group to post a 14% drop in earnings per share for FY2018 before rebounding in FY2019 and FY2020. Other heavyweights that registered lower profits include Telekom Malaysia Bhd and MISC Bhd. TM saw its net profit fall 32% y-o-y to RM157.16 million while MISC posted a 54.1% drop in net profit to RM310.6 million. Press Metal Holdings Bhd, which registered a 1.6% y-o-y growth in net profit to RM150.48 million, also missed expectations due to lower-than-expected aluminium selling prices realised, higher cost of carbon anode and the stronger ringgit. \u201cIt has been another disappointing quarter. Many companies performed below expectations ... the market largely expected some improvement in corporate earnings in the first quarter. \u201cMost sectors were down. Those with exposure to foreign exchange were affected by the stronger ringgit. They include the plantation, timber and technology sectors. I\u2019m expecting more negative earnings revisions than positive ones after the results season ends,\u201d Areca Capital CEO Danny Wong tells The Edge. He says the market was expecting some improvement in the first quarter of the year amid steady global growth. He notes that some construction companies had several contracts in hand, which were expected to give the sector a boost. However, this was not the case. IJM Corp Bhd posted a net profit of RM11.19 million, down 95.3% y-o-y. The big variance was mainly due to a one-off gain of RM123.1 million in the previous year and lower contributions from its five main segments. The group also saw a lower net unrealised foreign exchange gain for the quarter. Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd, despite posting 150% y-o-y growth in its net profit to RM21.5 million in 1QFY2018, also came in below expectations, according to MIDF Research. The earnings represent only 10.6% of the research house\u2019s estimates. AmInvestment Bank head of equity research Joshua Ng says the earnings reporting season was unremarkable with Sime Darby Bhd being the only FBM KLCI component stock that has surprised on the upside on better sales by its car dealerships in China and heavy equipment business in Australia. \u201cAfter factoring in the changes thus far, our FBM KLCI earnings growth forecast for 2018 has been revised to 5.4% (from 6.8%) and 2019 to 6.8% (from 7.2%),\u201d writes Ng in a June 1 note. Moving forward, AmInvestment Bank says, the removal of the Goods and Services Tax, reintroduction of petrol subsidy and the gradual abolition of highway tolls will increase consumers\u2019 propensity to spend. The research house prefers Public Bank Bhd and BIMB Holdings Bhd for their exposure to consumer spending, besides consumer and automotive stocks such as Berjaya Food Bhd, Power Root Bhd and Bermaz Auto Bhd. It also likes exporters that benefit from strong external demand such as Top Glove Corp Bhd, VS Industry Bhd and Inari Amertron Bhd as well as certain defensive oil and gas counters, such as Yinson Holdings Bhd and Dialog Bhd, amid stable crude oil prices. Looking towards the second quarter of the year, Areca Capital\u2019s Wong says he expects certain sectors to be positive such as consumers, automotive, banking and healthcare, amid better consumer sentiment. \u201cThe removal of GST will have a positive effect on consumer spending and it is particularly so for the automotive sector. Companies that import cars such as Sime Darby will benefit,\u201d he says. \u201cImproved consumer sentiment will translate into higher spending, which is positive for the retail sector.\u201d On the other hand, he says, the earnings of export-oriented counters that are not actively expanding will continue to be affected by the stronger ringgit. \u00a0 \u00a0"}, "19": {"date_posted": "31/5/2018", "title": "Off-Market Trades: ATTA Global Group Bhd, Meda Inc Bhd, ES Ceramics Technology Bhd, T7 Global Bhd, Sapura Energy Bhd, Sime Darby Plantation Bhd, Sime Darby Property Bhd ", "article": " ATTA Global Group Bhd saw more than 10% of its share base change hands off market at a discount to open market prices last Tuesday, the second day of trading after a three-day closure the week before.

In the stock market, Maybank will be watched after its shares fell sharply last Thursday on large volume, likely because of concerns over its exposure to Singapore-listed water treatment company Hyflux Ltd, which sought court protection on May 22 to reorganise its business and address its debt pile. Maybank closed 42 sen, or 3.9%, lower to RM10.26 last Thursday, with 84.9 million shares traded, more than double the previous day. The following day, the stock closed flat. Maybank\u2019s Singapore branch had provided an 18-year S$720 million financing facility to Hyflux\u2019s Tuaspring project in 2013. Moody\u2019s Investors Service, however, said in a statement last Friday that the potential losses to Maybank should be limited as it believes the bank\u2019s exposure has decreased since 2013 because of loan amortisation.

The weighted average age of SD Plantation\u2019s palm trees in Indonesia is about 14 years, slightly older than the group\u2019s average of about 13 years. Hence, some estates in Indonesia have started their replanting programme at a faster rate. This, together with certain areas in Kalimantan having not fully recovered from El Nino, caused its fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production in Indonesia for first half of financial year 2018 (1HFY18) to be lower by 5% year-on-year (y-o-y). Maintain \u201chold\u201d on SD Plantation with an unchanged 12-month TP of RM5.35. The weighted average age of the palm trees in Indonesia is about 14 years, slightly older than the group\u2019s average of about 13 years. In particular, at the PT Aneka Intipersada estates that we visited, about 46% of the total palm trees within 9,656ha of planted area are aged between 19 years and 25 years. Hence, these estates have started a replanting programme at a higher rate of 4%-7% of the total planted area per annum, in order to be in line with the group\u2019s target of reducing its average palm tree age to about 10 years by FY25. For 1HFY18, SD Plantation\u2019s Indonesia FFB yield was flat y-o-y at 8.91 megatonnes per hectare, lower than the 12.8 megatonnes per hectare in Malaysia and 9.76 megatonnes per hectare in Papua New Guinea. Indonesia\u2019s 1HFY18 FFB production was down by 5% y-o-y to 1.44 million, partly attributable to smaller prime matured areas due to the aggressive replanting programme as well as certain estates in Kalimantan area not having fully recovered from the 2015-2016 El Nino phenomenon. The selection of high-quality planting materials, stringent culling process, and adoption of best estate management practices could potentially help improve the Indonesian production going forward. There is no problem getting labour in Indonesia, but the rising minimum wage is a concern. As such, more mechanisation needs to be put in place at the Indonesian operations. Failure to do so could lead to a higher cost of production in Indonesia. We make no changes to our FY18-FY20 core earnings per share (EPS) estimates and 12-month TP of RM5.35, which is based on an unchanged 25 times calendar year 2018 core EPS estimate.

The construction group, which specialises in the provision of earthworks and civil engineering services, had an outstanding order book of RM957.24 million as of March 22, which is expected to last the group until the end of next year. However, the performance of its share price has not matched the excitement from the job wins. Though the price did increase slightly each time the group announced a job, it would quickly retreat subsequently. Since listing, the highest price achieved was RM1.20, which was recorded on Nov 1. Thereafter, it had been on a seesaw, and closed at a record low of 61 sen last Friday \u2014 3% lower than its initial public offering price of 63 sen \u2014 with a market capitalisation of RM245.27 million. Advancecon group chief executive officer Datuk Phum Ang Kia opined that the market should be left to decide on the best valuation for the group. \u201cThe movement in our share price is beyond our control as it is the market that decides,\u201d he told The Edge Financial Daily. \u201cOn our part we will work hard to deliver and secure new projects. And we believe we will give [investors] confidence in our company.\u201d On what\u2019s in store for the group, Phum who has over 40 years of experience in the construction industry said Advancecon intends to grow its order book to RM1 billion this year. \u201cWe believe that 2018 will be a good year for us. We will continue to tender for jobs. Our tender book size is about RM1.5 billion, which is a good mixture of infrastructure and property projects,\u201d he said. He added that listing on the stock market has definitely helped Advancecon enhance its profile in the industry. \u201cBefore listing, our order book was approximately RM572 million, and now it is close to RM1 billion. We have also managed to secure new clients, such as SKVE Holdings Sdn Bhd and Worldwide Property Management Sdn Bhd,\u201d he said. Last November, Advancecon subsidiary Advancecon Infra Sdn Bhd (AISB) won a RM75.5 million contract from SKVE to carry out earthworks and infrastructure works on the South Klang Valley Expressway . The following month, Advancecon announced that Worldwide had appointed AISB as the main contractor for earthworks for the 439-acre (177.66ha) Alam Perdana development in Ijok, Kuala Selangor, for a contract sum of RM45.83 million. Advancecon\u2019s single-largest job win to date came in last month when it announced that AISB had bagged the contract for works on the West Coast Expressway (WCE) stretch from the Assam Jawa Interchange to the Tanjung Karang Interchange. The contract awarded by West Coast Expressway Sdn Bhd \u2014 a unit of WCE Holdings Bhd \u2014 is valued at RM370.1 million, and entails AISB undertaking earthworks, ground treatment works, drainage and box culverts, pavements and bridges. This marks the second WCE job win for Advancecon. In December 2016, the group was awarded a RM239.8 million contract to undertake earthworks and civil works for the Banting Interchange to the South Klang Valley Expressway stretch of the highway. The group has also made inroads into East Malaysia, when it clinched a RM105.23 million contract in December 2016 for the provision of earthworks of the Pan Borneo Highway project, from the Sungai Awik Bridge to the Bintangor Junction in Sarawak. \u201cWe are looking to expand our presence in Sabah and Sarawak by securing more infrastructure jobs there,\u201d said Phum. The group also counts major property developers in the country as its clients, such as S P Setia Bhd, Eco World Development Group Bhd, Sime Darby Property Bhd and Tropicana Corp Bhd. Advancecon has reported a net profit of RM18.46 million and revenue of RM265.99 million for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2017 (FY17), resulting in a net profit margin of 7%. \u201cWe intend to grow our revenue by 10% to 20% per year in line with our contracts in hand,\u201d said Phum. Based on its closing price of 61 sen last Friday, the group is valued at a historical price-earnings ratio of 13.28 times. The group\u2019s specialty in the provision of earthworks makes it a niche player in the construction industry, and unlike other players in the industry, the group\u2019s operations are not so reliant on foreign workers. \u201cForeign workers only make up 10% of our total workforce, and in fact our jobs are not so labour-intensive \u2014 we only need people to operate our machinery. \u201cWe set aside about RM15 million to RM20 million per year just to buy new machinery,\u201d said Phum. It is also worth noting that the specialty in earthworks gives the group an advantage when it comes to one of the biggest woes commonly cited by construction players \u2014 payment collection. This is because the nature of earthwork jobs means that Advancecon would be the first to commence work for any construction project, and in that sense it would need to get paid first in order for any project to progress. \u201c[For] any development, be it townships or infrastructure projects, you need to prepare an earth platform before a building contractor can commence a job. If we are not paid, we can\u2019t complete the job and subsequent contractors can\u2019t come in to do their job. So that puts us in a unique position when it comes to payment collection,\u201d said Phum. As at FY17, Advancecon\u2019s cash and cash equivalents, coupled with its short-term investments, stood at RM23.97 million, while its total borrowings amounted to RM108.2 million. Its net gearing ratio works out to 0.48 times. The group has a dividend policy to distribute a minimum 20% of its net profit. \u00a0"}, "32": {"date_posted": "5/4/2018", "title": "Investors positive on Sime Darby Property\u2019s outlook", "article": " Sime Darby Property Bhd\n(April 4, RM1.38)\nMaintain add with a target price (TP) of RM1.85: We recently hosted Sime Darby Property Bhd\u2019s management in a non-deal roadshow in London, the UK, during which we met 10 fund managers and buy-side analysts at the two-day event. Investors were generally positive on the group\u2019s outlook, given its strategic land bank and ongoing transformation post demerger. Investors were interested in the group\u2019s UK Battersea Power Station joint-venture project, its transformation progress and growth strategies post demerger. Currently, Sime Darby Property is still Malaysia\u2019s largest property developer in terms of land bank size (20,743 acres or 8,394ha), with remaining gross development value (GDV) of RM96 billion. This excludes the additional 20,599 acres of land under option agreements with Sime Darby Plantation and Sime Darby Bhd. Most of the group\u2019s land bank is strategically located with good connectivity \u2014 either with easy access to expressways or public transportation. Sime Darby Property is disposing of non-strategic land outside of its key developments to enhance land value and expedite development via other developers. The group has identified land for disposal (in Kedah) and will be rewarding shareholders through dividends. Given its near-net cash balance sheet and potentially higher profit from land disposals, we do not rule out the possibility of a higher dividend payout in the future versus its current dividend policy of a 20% payout. Sime Darby Property also organised a site visit to its 40%-owned Battersea Power Station in conjunction with the roadshow to provide investors greater insight into the project. The Battersea Power Station spans across 42 acres of land, with an estimated total GDV of \u00a39 billion (RM48.8 billion) that will be launched over seven phases. The overall project looks attractive, as the land acquisition cost of \u00a3400 million translates into only about 4% of the total estimated GDV (versus 10% to 20% for normal projects). Phase 1 has been completed, and Phase 2 will be ready by end-2020. We value the stock based on a 50% discount to our estimate of its revalued net asset value, translating into a TP of RM1.85. The large discount versus an average of 35% we attach to the other property stocks under our coverage is to reflect the slower monetisation and longer gestation period of its considerable land bank. Our valuation does not include the potential value enhancement from the additional land bank of 20,602 acres under Malaysia Vision Valley option agreements and land option agreements. Potential rerating catalysts include a ramp-up in launches and new property sales.

Of course, it is nowhere near CCM Duopharma Biotech Bhd, one of the country\u2019s leading pharmaceuticals manufacturers, or PNB\u2019s crown jewel Malayan Banking Bhd, the country\u2019s largest lender by assets. Both investments have proven lucrative \u2014 giving the fund returns of more than 100% over the past 10 years. However, UMW\u2019s performance in terms of total returns at least has fared better than other PNB investee companies such as Sime Darby Bhd and MNRB Holdings Bhd. Bloomberg data shows that before its demerger exercise at the end of last year, Sime Darby had delivered returns of 14.36% to its shareholders over the previous 10 years while reinsurer MNRB Holdings had chalked up returns of 5.24%. Recall that UMW had a great financial year 2012 ended Dec 31, attaining RM2 billion in profit before tax mainly owing to record sales in its automotive division. But the slump in crude oil prices that started in mid-2014 coupled with the depreciation of the ringgit against the US dollar that affected its automotive sector resulted in the group slipping into the red in 2015 with a net loss of RM37.2 million. Though in a loss-making position in 2015, UMW paid out dividends albeit at a lower rate compared to prior years. The total dividend per share declared was 20 sen, a drastic fall from the 50 sen given out in 2012. The dividend was also lower than Sime Darby\u2019s 25 sen in the same year. UMW\u2019s dividend yield fell from 5.79% in 2012 to 2.07% in 2015. Prior to slipping into the red, UMW had kept its dividend payout ratio at between 57.7% and 76.1% from 2008 to 2014. The group has not declared dividends for the past two financial years, which did not sit well with shareholders chasing dividend gains. UMW\u2019s returns are lower than that of other automotive players such as DRB-Hicom Bhd, which owns a 50.1% stake in national carmaker Proton, and the country\u2019s largest Mercedes-Benz dealer Cycle & Carriage Bintang Bhd. Over the past 10 years, DRB delivered returns of 156.51% while Cycle & Carriage made 116.57%. Note, however, that it might not be fair to compare UMW with DRB-Hicom as the latter is a more diversified group with interests in logistics, property, financial services and construction. UMW\u2019s returns are also lower than that of its target acquiree MBM Resources Bhd, which delivered total returns of 58.49% to its shareholders over the past 10 years. Nevertheless, the announcement of the proposed takeover seems to have got the market excited over UMW\u2019s prospects. RHB Research in a March 12 note upgraded the stock to a \u201cbuy\u201d from a \u201csell\u201d, with a target price of RM6.91. \u201c[MBM\u2019s] Daihatsu and Hino distribution franchises would broaden UMW\u2019s commercial vehicle offerings, given their focus on small- and mid-sized trucks. \u201cWe do not expect any objections from UMW\u2019s key principal, Toyota, given that Daihatsu and Hino are already key companies within the Toyota Motor Group. MBM Resources\u2019 autoparts business would also fit in seamlessly with UMW\u2019s manufacturing and engineering division. The new ownership structure could also offer more supply contract opportunities for MBM Resources\u2019 troubled alloy wheel manufacturing business,\u201d RHB Research says. MIDF Research in a March 14 note was equally positive about the deal. \u201cWhile we expect an initial share price pressure given the potential cash call to fund the acquisitions, we suggest investors buy into UMW as it would be a good deal if it is successful, given UMW\u2019s potentially cheap entry into MBM at just eight times FY19F earnings and effective 6% to 7% dividend yield attained from Perodua at the entry price,\u201d the firm says.

Our second stop was Bandar Bukit Raja (BBR), which consists of two mixed development townships, namely BBR 1 (1,513 acres) and BBR 2 & 3 (2,820 acres). BBR is located 30 minutes away from Port Klang, making it an ideal hub for international freight and logistics activities, in our view.

Ruchi Soya, currently undergoing bankruptcy proceedings under India\u2019s National Company Law Tribunal, has a 19% market share in India for its downstream edible oil products, said Mohd Bakke. Two other global players, Musim Mas Group and Cargill Archer Daniels Midland, have expressed interest in Ruchi Soya, according to a CNBC report on Monday. Other bidders for Ruchi Soya include Adani Wilmar, Godrej Agrovet, and Patanjali & Emami, the report said. Listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Ruchi Soya has a market capitalisation of RM5.63 billion based on its share price of RM17. Last year, DBS Bank and Standard Chartered Bank filed insolvency proceedings against the firm. Mohd Bakke also said a strategic investor from Papua New Guinea (PNG) would be an ideal buyer for a 40% to 49% stake in Sime Darby Plantation\u2019s 100%-owned New Britain Palm Oil Ltd (NBPOL) in PNG. Although several funds have expressed interest, \u201cwe have not arrived at any satisfactory conclusions so far\u201d, Mohd Bakke said, adding that a deal would only be considered at the right time and for the right price. However, he maintains that the divestment has \u201calways been a part of the plan\u201d since Sime Darby Plantation\u2019s acquisition of the plantation firm for \u00a31.07 billion in March 2015. It initially offered to buy all of Kulim (M) Bhd\u2019s 48.97% stake in NBPOL at \u00a37.15 per share, triggering a general offer for the remaining shares accepted by shareholders at the time. Going forward, Mohd Bakke said crude palm oil (CPO) prices would hover between RM2,500 and RM2,600 until June, affected by seasonal weakness, poor weather and high soybean production. Over 100,000ha or some 20% of the group\u2019s land bank were affected by bad weather that continued into January this year, said Helmy Othman Basha, chief operating officer of Sime Darby Plantation\u2019s upstream segment. \u201cAbout 50% of our production area in PNG and Kalimantan, Indonesia, are affected,\u201d he said, adding that although improvements have been seen, the group would take precautions against bad weather. Despite this, Mohd Bakke said CPO production is expected to increase in line with the expected growth in Malaysia\u2019s total production of 20.5 million to 21.1 million tonnes compared with last year\u2019s 20 million tonnes. \u201cWe hope to see the trend continuing for the second half of 2018,\u201d he said, as the group expects to close the current financial year ending June 30, 2018 (FY18) on a \u201csatisfactory note\u201d. Mohd Bakke said a ban on palm oil used in biodiesel by the European Union would pose a negligible impact on Sime Darby Plantation, as he expects higher demand for palm oil for usage in food instead. He added that the weather, a strong ringgit, and market demand and supply would always be risks monitored by the palm oil industry. Yesterday, Sime Darby Plantation posted a 34.5% increase in net profit to RM477 million for the second quarter ended Dec 31, 2017 (2QFY18) due to higher contributions from its local upstream operations and reduced finance costs as a result of lower borrowings. Revenue gained 4.1% to RM4.09 billion, while fresh fruit bunch production improved 2% to 2.76 million tonnes as output recovered from the El Nino weather phenomenon. For the cumulative six months, net profit more than tripled to RM1.45 billion due to a gain on the sale of land to Sime Darby Property Bhd at RM676 million, as well as a one-off reversal of accruals of RM95 million in 1QFY18. Excluding the gain on the land sale, normalised net profit for the six months was 39.8% higher at RM657 million, from RM470 million a year ago, mainly driven by its Malaysian upstream operations.

According to CEO Datuk Michael Teh, the listing of the home-grown construction company last August has strengthened its financial capability to capture bigger PPP projects under private finance initiative (PFI) programmes. \u201cThe concession business is rather capital intensive. But today, with our fundraising capabilities, we have the financial muscle to grab opportunities not only in the home market, but also regionalise our businesses and participate in larger-scale projects,\u201d he tells The Edge in an interview. Founded in 1996, BGMC provides a wide range of construction services and has the capability to undertake PPP projects based on the build, lease, maintain and transfer (BLMT) model, which will allow it to generate long-term recurring cash flow. Other areas the group is involved in are mechanical and electrical, energy transmission and distribution, building and structures, as well as earthworks and infrastructure. Prominent customers include Sime Darby Group, Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) and Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd. Last August, BGMC became the first Malaysian construction firm to list on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. Teh says Southeast Asia is anticipated to be a big market for the group in the next couple of years because of the \u201chumongous\u201d appetite for infrastructure investments. Asean has 650 million people, or roughly 9% of the global population, he points out. \u201cIf we can find some projects that suit our profile, we will definitely grab the opportunity to venture overseas.\u201d He says BGMC intends to replicate its existing BLMT or PPP concession model overseas. \u201cIt could be anything \u2014 energy, school, hospital. We have the track record in building a campus on the BLMT model. This will give us a competitive edge in convincing governments in other countries that we have the ability to deliver,\u201d he says confidently. BGMC clinched a BLMT project for the Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Dengkil campus, with a 23-year deal \u2014 three years for the construction and 20 years for asset management services. The concession was signed in 2012 and the campus, which can accommodate 5,000 students, was successfully delivered in the final quarter of 2015. Teh says Dengkil is the smallest of UiTM\u2019s campuses in terms of land size at only 47 acres. \u201cIt is a very comprehensive and compact campus with all the necessary facilities for the benefit of students. Upon expiry, we will transfer it back to the university at no cost as it [the project] would have been paid off within the concession period,\u201d he says. It is learnt that the construction cost for the campus is about RM290 million. BGMC will receive a total concession fee of more than RM58 million yearly \u2014 RM48 million as fixed or availability charges, and RM10.1 million for maintenance. \u00a0 Kuala Muda solar plant The UiTM Dengkil campus is currently the only concession project the group has. But it has another in the pipeline \u2014 a 30mw solar power plant in Kuala Muda, Kedah. Last December, BGMC received a bid acceptance letter from the Energy Commission of Malaysia to construct and develop the large-scale AC solar photovoltaic (PV) plant. According to the EC\u2019s official announcement, BGMC submitted the bid with its joint-venture partner Bras Venture Bhd. The parties involved are in the midst of negotiations on the power purchase agreement (PPA) with the off-taker, TNB. Teh points out that over the years, BGMC has been involved in energy transmission and distribution \u2014 one of its bread-and-butter businesses \u2014 building infrastructure for the power industry, including substations and underground cables. \u201cWe are quite confident of delivering the project because we have the experience in the energy business. Bras Venture, who is our existing client, is also a power specialist, so we choose them as a partner to cut short our learning curve,\u201d he says. He estimates the Kuala Muda project will have a shorter gestation period of two years, but a slightly longer concession period of 21 years. \u201cAt the moment, we can\u2019t reveal the estimated construction cost and concession fee but I can say that this project is smaller than UiTM Dengkil Campus in size.\u201d BGMC is named after its founding chairman and executive director Tan Sri Barry Goh Ming Choon, a farmer\u2019s son from a small village in Sitiawan, Perak, who owns a 48% stake. He is better known as the co-founder of property firm MCT Bhd, which recently received a mandatory general offer from Philippine property conglomerate Ayala Land Inc. Goh was once the second-largest shareholder of MCT with a 27.24% stake and was previously the executive deputy chairman before he was redesignated as non-executive director in November 2016. Early this month, he sold his 17.24% stake in MCT to Ayala Land for RM202.5 million, but remains a substantial shareholder with a 10% stake. While Teh acknowledges that Goh is a common shareholder of BGMC and MCT, he stresses that for the time being, the former does not get any job from the latter. \u201cWe do not ask Tan Sri (Goh) about his personal interests in other listed companies,\u201d he says. Going back to BGMC, for the financial year ended Sept 30, 2017 (FY2017), the group saw its gross profit grow 23% year on year to RM128.1 million as revenue grew 34% to RM694.9 million. It is worth noting that while BGMC\u2019s net profit declined 13% y-o-y to RM54.8 million in FY2017, its pro forma net profit rose 8% y-o-y to RM70.6 million, excluding listing expenses. The concessions and maintenance segment contributed RM10.5 million to overall revenue, and imputed interest income amounted to RM43.7 million in FY2017. To recap, BGMC offered a total of 450 million shares at an offer price of 70 HK cents\u00a0 to raise RM143 million. Year to date, the counter has declined 3% to close at 57 HK cents last Thursday, giving it a market capitalisation of HK$1.03 billion. \u00a0"}, "43": {"date_posted": "24/1/2018", "title": "FBM KLCI could climb 5%-10% in 2018, says \u2018Warren Buffett of Asia\u2019", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: Driven by a stronger ringgit, the local benchmark index FBM KLCI is expected to rise as much as 10% this year, according to prominent fund manager Datuk Seri Cheah Cheng Hye, who is known as the Warren Buffett of Asia. \u201cThe Malaysian equity market is one of the markets that show continuity growth.

The visit was hosted by Appollo Leong, general manager of Business Unit 1 (City of Elmina, Denai Alam, Bukit Jelutong & USJ Heights Townships).\u00a0 The 5,000-acre (2,023.43ha) City of Elmina, which includes Elmina West (2,661 acres), Elmina East (1,089 acres), Denai Alam and Bukit Subang (1,250 acres), is located along the Guthrie Corridor Expressway (GCE). With a remaining developable area of 3,583 acres and remaining gross development value (GDV) of RM20.4 billion, it is currently the biggest township in Sime Darby Property\u2019s portfolio. It contributes about 24% of the total remaining GDV of RM85.9 billion. City of Elmina is located 21km west of Kuala Lumpur City Centre. The township has good connectivity via the GCE (through Denai Alam and Elmina Interchange), Shah Alam-Batu Arang Highway, New Klang Valley Expressway, Kuala Lumpur-Kuala Selangor Expressway, and the proposed Damansara-Shah Alam Elevated Expressway (DASH), which is slated for completion in 2020.

The launches in City of Elmina will contribute about 33% of its planned GDV launches of about RM2.6 billion in FY18. With the recent ramp-up in project launches, we believe FY18 sales will likely exceed FY17 sales of RM1.92 billion.\u00a0 While we expect the property market in 2018 to stay uninspiring, we think the group will likely benefit from the upcoming high-speed rail project and development of the Malaysia Vision Valley.\u00a0 We value the stock based on a 50% discount to our estimate of its revalued net asset value, translating into a TP of RM1.85.

The excitement is set to continue for Bursa Malaysia ahead of the 14th general election (GE14), with the local market showing first signs of the much-anticipated pre-election rally since Jan 3. \u201cThe market has been on a strong upward trend amid the recovering ringgit and stronger oil price. Talk of a pre-election rally has resurfaced among investors, as well as in the media. While we see some profit-taking activities as we approach the end of our second week of trading, we believe the weakness in the market presents a good buying opportunity for investors and traders,\u201d Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd head of research Kenny Yee told The Edge Financial Daily. \u201cWe think that the high spirits leading to the elections, as well as the euphoria in the stock market seen in the developed markets will fuel the momentum in the domestic stock market,\u201d he added. Echoing the same sentiment, TA Securities research head Kaladher Govindan is of the view that the strong run in the benchmark index so far this year is in line with expectations. \u201cIt was within our expectations if you follow our strategy reports. We expect the FBM KLCI to hit 1,890 points in the first half of 2018 (1H18), especially in the first quarter before retreating in 2H18,\u201d Kaladher said via email. In its annual strategy report published on Dec 8 last year, TA Securities wrote that expectations of a GE14 rally should propel the FBM KLCI higher in 1H18, premised on the assumption the elections will be held in March or April this year. However, Kaladher highlighted a possible correction in the market in 1H18. \u201cA Barisan Nasional victory could hold up on the market momentarily, but we reckon the FBM KLCI could be due for a correction in 2H18 as concerns over the US monetary tightening and ringgit weakness reverberate across the market and translate into heavy foreign selling and a risk-averse strategy among investors,\u201d he added. However, Kaladher noted that the downside pressure can emerge sooner in 1H18 if the current ruling coalition\u2019s power base crumbles after the elections. Affin Hwang Asset Management is also optimistic about a better year in 2018 and expects the FBM KLCI to see a 6% to 8% upside, tracking market earnings growth. \u201cAnalysts are starting the year with a projection of 9% to 10% [growth]. The expectation is that the stronger ringgit will lead to margin expansion [as opposed to contraction] for domestic-oriented companies,\u201d its senior associate director of equities Cheryl Pola said. The FBM KLCI has climbed 8.6% over the past year. However, CIMB Investment Bank head of Malaysia research Ivy Ng believes the market still has legs to run, maintaining an end-2018 FBM KLCI target of 1,880 points. The local market ended the week on a positive note last week, with the FBM KLCI closing 5.79 points or 0.32% higher at 1,822.67. Market breadth was positive with 643 gainers versus 389 losers. Taking a look at the 30 constituents of the FBM KLCI, the best-performing stock so far is Sime Darby Bhd. The counter climbed 22.2% year to date (YTD) to close at RM2.70 last Friday. This was followed by Petronas Gas Bhd and YTL Corp Bhd, with gains of 8.7% and 8% respectively. Six of the FBM KLCI component stocks were on a downtrend, with KLCCP Stapled Group emerging as the worst performer YTD, falling 9.1% to close unchanged at RM7.85 last Friday. Apart from Axiata Group Bhd, the telecommunication sector has turned out to be a laggard YTD, with shares in DiGi.Com Bhd and Telekom Malaysia Bhd declining by 7.8% and 4.8% respectively. Maxis Bhd remained unchanged at RM6.01 last Friday. Sime Darby Plantation Bhd saw its share price fall 7.8% YTD to close at RM5.53 last Friday \u2014 moving in the opposite direction of Sime Darby. Despite a strong start to the year, the FBM KLCI is still underperforming its regional peers and developed markets. The Edge Financial Daily has spoken to several heads of research on some of the potential stocks they see among the component stocks that could run higher on the back of the positive sentiment in the global equity market, recovering oil prices and the ringgit, as well as the boost from the upcoming GE14. 1) Tenaga Nasional Bhd\u00a0 A screaming buy among analysts, Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) rose 3.4% in the first two weeks of the year. Most analysts continue to favour TNB as Bloomberg data shows that 20 out of 25 analysts that cover the stock have a \u201cbuy\u201d call. According to Rakuten Trade\u2019s Yee, the utility company\u2019s valuation is undemanding and provides decent dividend yield. At its closing price of RM15.78 last Friday, TNB is trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio (PER) of 12.9 times and has a dividend yield of about 3.9%. TNB is also CIMB\u2019s top three big caps for 2018 as Ng sees the stock offer a resilient organic earnings growth potential. According to her, it is building four new power plants in Malaysia, which could raise its generation earnings in 2017 to 2020. She also pointed out that stronger earnings driven by the new assets TNB acquired in the past year are another potential rerating catalyst. TA Securities, which has a target price (TP) of RM17.38 for TNB, indicating a potential return of about 10%, has also picked the utility company as one of its top picks. TA Securities analyst Kylie Chan Sze Zan said in an annual strategy report that TNB is attractive on most valuation metrics, including a 10.9 times forward PER, which is one standard deviation below historical average, 7.1 times forward enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, which is an 18% discount to regional peers. Based on Bloomberg\u2019s consensus data, the 12-month TP for TNB is at RM16.61, indicating a potential return of 5.3%. TNB was also one of the stocks that featured on The Edge Financial Daily\u2019s Top 10 Picks for 2018. 2) Axiata Group Bhd\u00a0 Axiata Group Bhd is expected to perform in 2018 as the telecommunication company is expected to see an improvement in its earnings after witnessing four consecutive years of earnings contraction at its operating companies \u2014 Celcom Axiata Bhd and Indonesia\u2019s PT XL Axiata Tbk. The turnaround appears to be expected by the market as seen by the gain of 1.1% in the first 10 trading days of 2018. This was in contrast to its share price performance in the last three years where it fell by about 14.6%. According to CIMB\u2019s Ng, Axiata\u2019s core earnings per share is expected to rebound by a strong 29% and 50% for its forecast for financial years ending Dec 31, 2018 and 2019 respectively due to much higher contributions from XL, net profit break-even for Airtel Bangladesh Ltd by end-2018 and cessation in equity accounting for Idea\u2019s losses post-merger with Vodafone. Rakuten\u2019s Yee concurred, noting that Axiata\u2019s digital transformation is expected to bring an improvement to its earnings. \u201cOther than that, the news flow of a potential initial public offering of its tower unit, edotco Group Sdn Bhd, this year is also another catalyst for Axiata,\u201d he said. 3) Banking sector \u2014\u00a0CIMB, Maybank Affin Hwang Asset Management\u2019s Pola is of the view that banks are among those that could do well in 2018. \u201cThis year has been about improvement in asset quality. In 2018, we should see stronger pre-provision growth, especially if interest rates rise, which will lead to net interest margin expansion [but to a lesser extent compared to its Singapore counterparts],\u201d she said. She added that loan growth should be slightly stronger after the disappointing 2017. Pola, however, noted that there is still an overhang on the sector as the impact of Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards 9 (MFRS9) has yet to be fully known but if the impact on provisions or book values is low as expected, it would clear another uncertainty that remains for the banking sector. \u201cOur top picks are CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (inexpensive valuations) and Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) (possibility of capital management after MFRS9, better cash dividends, the possible listing of Etiqa). Hong Leong Bank Bhd has impressive fundamentals but valuations are a bit stretched,\u201d she added. Similar to Pola, Rakuten\u2019s Yee highlighted that both CIMB and Maybank could be proxy for foreign buying into the banking sector. \u201cMaybank is also a defensive play with its relatively high dividend yield of over 5%,\u201d he added. TA Securities also picked CIMB as one of its top picks for 2018 in its annual strategy report. Its analyst Wong Li Hsia said CIMB has been outpacing its peers in terms of yearly profit growth since the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2015. She also pointed that better prospects in CIMB Niaga and CIMB Thai as one of the investment themes that will drive CIMB. \u201cCredit charges have eased. While we forecast the overall credit charge to remain elevated, we believe the worst \u2014 in terms of asset quality may be over, led by further recoveries in its overseas operations,\u201d Wong said. CIMB\u2019s share price gained 3.7% YTD to close at RM6.78 last Friday, while Maybank\u2019s share price edged higher by 0.5% to RM9.85. 4. Petronas Gas Bhd The selldown at the end of last year created a value proportion for those who are interested in investing in Petronas Gas Bhd (PetGas). The share price fell by 4.8% compared with three years ago to its closing price of RM19.00 last Friday. PetGas\u2019 share price fell to its low of RM15.88 in November last year compared with its three-year peak of RM22.02 in October 2015. Yee believes that the selldown was overdone and was mainly due to third-party access framework concern. While the market has recovered by 19.6% from its low since then, PetGas is still trading at about 4.9% below its three-year average price of RM19.93.\n\u00a0"}, "48": {"date_posted": "5/1/2018", "title": "Sime Darby Plantation largest planter in Malaysia", "article": " Sime Darby Plantation Bhd\n(Jan 4, RM5.55)\nInitiate with a neutral call with a target price of RM5.68: Sime Darby Plantation Bhd, which is formerly part of Sime Darby Bhd, has become a pure play plantation company following the completion of the demerger exercise. On Nov 30, Sime Darby Plantation and Sime Darby Property were demerged from Sime Darby Bhd through a share split exercise, where the shareholding remains the same for all the three entities during post-demerger. Indeed, the demerger exercise helps lift the plantation valuation from the previous range of 18 times to 20 times to the current level of 28 times to 30 times, which is more reflective of its substantial market share in the palm oil industry. In addition, a purer play plantation stock fetches higher valuation. Sime Darby Plantations is the world\u2019s largest oil palm plantation company with a total planted area of 602,454ha, spanning across Malaysia, Indonesia, PNG & Solomon Islands and Liberia. It produces 2.48 million tonnes of crude palm oil (CPO) annually or about 4% of the total global CPO production. It is a globally integrated plantation company, involving the entire span of the palm oil value chain, from upstream to downstream activities, research and development, renewables and agribusiness. It is also involved in rubber and sugarcane plantations as well as cattle rearing. The upstream segment is the biggest earnings contributor to the group, making up more than 96% of the group\u2019s earnings. The downstream segment accounted for the balance. We think the current share price has fully reflected the muted CPO price performance. We forecast a financial year ending June 30, 2018 (FY18) to FY20 earnings per share compound annual growth rate of 4%, taking into account an average CPO price of RM2,500 per tonne to RM2,550 per tonne. The assumption is in line with our neutral stance on the plantation sector and current CPO price performance. Based on our sensitivity analysis, for every RM100 per tonne variance in CPO prices, Sime Darby Plantation\u2019s bottom line would vary by 10% to 12%. \u2014 PublicInvest Research, Jan 4"}, "49": {"date_posted": "3/1/2018", "title": "Newsmakers 2017: Pumping money into Corporate Malaysia", "article": " THE year 2017 was exciting for Corporate Malaysia. Among others, it has seen institutional players such as bumiputera fund manager Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) and retirement fund the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) pump billions of ringgit into major corporate exercises. These injections of fresh capital come even as the benchmark FBM KLCI is set to end the year on a high, snapping a three-year streak of declines. Grabbing the headlines was PNB\u2019s massive restructuring, which began soon after its first management change in two decades last year. This year, the market saw major parts of the restructuring materialise as new chairman Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar sought to enhance corporate focus for better returns. In the process, PNB poured nearly RM2 billion into its major oil and gas investment, UMW Oil & Gas Bhd (UMWOG). But elsewhere, it cashed out, injecting privately held developer I&P Group Bhd into majority-controlled S P Setia Bhd for RM3.65 billion. As an aside, the year also marked an interesting milestone when DRB-Hicom Bhd sold a 49.9% stake in Proton Holdings Bhd to China\u2019s Zhejiang Geely Group Holding Co for RM460.3 million. Meantime, the EPF supported an eyebrow-raising RM2.8 billion cash call at Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (MRCB), the largest yet since the retirement fund brought in an entrepreneur to lead the company back in 2013.  \u00a0 Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar Group Chairman, Permodalan Nasional Bhd In what was his first full year at the helm of PNB, Abdul Wahid oversaw the breakup of not one but two of Malaysia\u2019s largest conglomerates with rich history. The first, announced in January, was a demerger of UMWOG from UMW Holdings Bhd. The latter\u2019s shares in its oil and gas arm were then transferred to its own shareholders. This made PNB the direct majority shareholder of UMWOG. The fund manager was to team up with Ekuiti Nasional Bhd on the demerger but the latter dropped out after the cash requirement was assessed to be larger than expected. Overall, PNB injected RM1.8 billion into UMWOG to improve its financial health in a persistently low oil price environment. The demerger was completed in July. Abdul Wahid also pulled the trigger on the long-discussed Sime Darby Bhd breakup, which saw the conglomerate separate into three individually listed entities on Nov 30. While talk of spin-off listings did the rounds for years, market conditions had previously been a hurdle, depressing potential initial public offering proceeds. Abdul Wahid sidestepped the issue by listing the plantation and property arms via share transfer to Sime Darby\u2019s existing shareholders, taking the chairman\u2019s role at Sime Darby Property in the process. These exercises were in keeping with his vision of creating pure-play companies among PNB\u2019s major holdings to enhance value and returns. With the next phase of his PNB restructuring \u2014 involving companies in which the fund manager has non-controlling stakes \u2014 yet to begin, the coming year promises more corporate excitement from Malaysia\u2019s Mr Fix-it. \u00a0 Tan Sri Mohd Bakke Salleh Executive deputy chairman and managing director, Sime Darby Plantation Bhd After years of planning, the breakup of Sime Darby finally took place this year. And Mohd Bakke, who used to oversee the conglomerate, has taken the hot seat in the spun-off plantation business. The breakup came 10 years after Sime Darby was formed in 2007, reversing a merger worth RM31 billion that was reportedly the biggest in Southeast Asia at the time. Mohd Bakke will be remembered as the CEO under whose watch the conglomerate unravelled. He took over in 2010 during turbulent times after RM2 billion of oil and gas-related losses, among others, forced out his predecessor. Given its diverse business profile, Sime Darby struggled with cyclical downturns at some businesses, which offset upcycles at others. It was dogged by a conglomerate discount, among others, which suppressed its value and which the breakup sought to remove by creating pure-play stocks. Mohd Bakke\u2019s team mooted a breakup even before the management change at majority shareholder PNB but they found it difficult to catch the proverbial boat due to changing market conditions. The arrival of Abdul Wahid at PNB provided the final impetus needed for the spin-offs. Mohd Bakke has been heading Sime Darby Plantation since its listing on Nov 30, reminiscent of his previous time at Felda Holdings Bhd, among others. At 63, this may be Mohd Bakke\u2019s last hurrah in Corporate Malaysia. In August, he told reporters that he plans to retire by 2019 after ensuring a smooth transition at Sime Darby Plantation. \u00a0 Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan CEO, the Employees Provident Fund When MRCB announced its biggest cash call in memory last May, it provoked an uproar from the minority shareholders. The one-for-one rights issue meant massive dilution for shareholders who opted out. The market did not like it either \u2014 the stock fell as much as 12% on May 18 when the cash call was announced. Prior to that, it had risen 30.8% since the beginning of the year. To recap, MRCB sought to raise up to RM2.8 billion but ended up with RM1.7 billion to pare down its borrowings and reconfigure its capital structure. However, immediately noticeable was the fact that the EPF, helmed by Shahril, and MRCB\u2019s largest shareholder with a 33.5% stake, supported the exercise. In June, barely a month after the rights issue was announced, the EPF said it was directly injecting RM1.14 billion into MRCB\u2019s Bukit Jalil development project. The retirement fund\u2019s financial support was seen as a vote of confidence in MRCB\u2019s management, led by the businessman that the EPF had brought in as head of the company via an asset injection in 2013. The move may also signal the retirement fund\u2019s continued commitment to MRCB\u2019s restructuring since 2013. In turn, this may possibly be among the defining corporate turnarounds under Shahril\u2019s watch as the EPF\u2019s chief, given MRCB\u2019s long history. Following the latest cash call and the EPF\u2019s money going into the Bukit Jalil project, MRCB\u2019s financial health is stronger and it is set to achieve net cash position. The year ahead will offer a glimpse of whether MRCB can repay the EPF\u2019s convictions with sustained earnings growth. \u00a0 Tan Sri Mohamad Salim Fateh Din Group managing director, Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd Since taking up the reins of MRCB in 2013, Salim has made plenty of progress in restructuring the company. But in May, he took the market by surprise with a massive cash request from shareholders despite having vastly improved the company\u2019s financial health by then. The proposed one-for-one rights issue sought as much as RM2.8 billion, the largest amount yet, and eventually raised RM1.7 billion. Both the EPF and Salim\u2019s vehicle, Gapurna Sdn Bhd, backed the cash call. To recap, Gapurna undertook an asset injection into MRCB in 2013. Salim became the latter\u2019s group managing director after emerging as a 16.8% shareholder. His appointment to the helm of the company marked a shift from MRCB\u2019s tradition of having professional managers run the outfit. After various exercises that included some asset disposals, debt restructuring and several private placements, the company\u2019s financial health was at its best in years. For perspective, as at December 2016, MRCB\u2019s gearing stood at 0.73 times. When Salim came on board back in 2013, it was at 1.73 times. MRCB said the cash was needed to rebalance its capital structure, which had too much debt relative to its shareholders\u2019 equity. The exercise would lower its gearing close to zero with another cash infusion from the EPF, moving it to a net cash position. For Salim, the completion of these exercises may mark the end of a major restructuring at MRCB and sets the stage for more focus on earnings growth and maximising the value of the company\u2019s land bank. Only time will tell how well he can deliver in order to justify the cash injections."}, "50": {"date_posted": "29/12/2017", "title": "FBM KLCI up 17.71pts on KLCCP, Sime Darby Plantation spike", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Dec 29): The FBM KLCI gained 17.71 points or 1% after\nan 11th-hour share price spike in index-linked KLCCP Stapled Group and Sime Darby Plantation Bhd pushed the 30-stock KLCI higher.\n\u00a0\nAt 5pm, the KLCI closed at its intraday high at 1,796.81 points for a year-to-date gain of 9.45%.

SP Setia was the fifth largest gainer after its share price increased 64 sen to RM4. CMMT gained 41 sen to RM1.83 to become the eighth largest advancer. Across Bursa Malaysia, trading volume was 3.14 billion shares worth RM2.77 billion. Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd head of research Chan Ken Yew told theedgemarkets.com that the KLCI's increase can be attributed to \"window dressing activities.\" \"Fundamentally, our (Malaysia) economic indicators are good as well,\" Chan said.

In my opinion, the property market is still holding up and transactions are still taking place, indicating that there is still demand for properties, provided the right kind of products at the right price and location are available in the market,\u201d said Nordin. According to data from JPPH\u2019s National Property Information Centre, the total real estate transaction volume was 229,529 in the first nine months of 2017, down 4.33% from 239,919 recorded in the corresponding period in 2016, which in turn was down 5.72% from the previous year. In 2015, the total volume of transactions was down by 11.5% from the corresponding period in 2014. \u201cThe property market is gradually adjusting to the changing economic environment, financial landscape and buyers\u2019 sentiment. In a way, we are probably seeing the property market reaching a new normal,\u201d Nordin told EdgeProp.my. Looking ahead, he believes properties in the Klang Valley will still be in demand, supported by economic growth and incentives for the housing sector. Nordin will share this and more about the property market outlook at the upcoming 11th Malaysian Property Summit organised by The Association of Valuers, Property Managers, Estate Agents and Property Consultants in the Private Sector Malaysia (PEPS). The summit will be held on Jan 23, 2018 at the Sime Darby Convention Centre in Kuala Lumpur. EdgeProp.my is the media partner. The upcoming summit will also feature PEPS president and CBRE|WTW managing director Foo Gee Jen who will be focusing on the residential property segment\u2019s performance and outlook in his session. Like Nordin, Foo also believes that improvements in the overall economy and positive housing policy changes would contribute to better property market conditions. However, the residential property sector is expected to be \u201cwobbly\u201d through the year as the market is beset with fundamental demand-supply mismatches in terms of pricing and locations, said Foo, citing CBRE|WTW data that showed that as of 2Q17, there was a residential overhang including serviced apartments and Small-office Home-office of 24,613 units. The overhang, he said, was contributed by a mismatch of supply of certain property segments in terms of pricing and location. \u201cThe residential housing market will recover when sales improve and the balance of unsold stock is cleared, but this has not happened yet. On top of that, some fundamental structural changes are needed. Until these changes are realised, we do not expect meaningful recovery any time soon,\u201d said Foo. Meanwhile, PPC International Penang Sdn Bhd executive director Mark Saw, who will be sharing insights into the property market in the country\u2019s northern region, said the commercial property sector in the northern region will continue to be very challenging in 2018 while the residential sector is expected to remain active. \u201cAs expected, 2017 has been a challenging year and transactions have again dipped, but certain sectors have remained active, such as the affordable housing sector and selected high-end developments. Hence, I foresee the property market to continue being sector-specific in 2018,\u201d he said. Other experts slated to speak at the summit include Knight Frank Malaysia Sdn Bhd managing director Sarkunan Subramaniam, Savills (M) Sdn Bhd deputy executive chairman Allan Soo, Rahim & Co International Sdn Bhd research director Sulaiman Akhmady Mohd Saheh, KGV International Property Consultants Sdn Bhd executive director Samuel Tan, TRX City Sdn Bhd CEO Datuk Azmar Talib, and MCA Belt and Road Centre deputy executive chairman Datuk Joseph Lim.

With most of the restructuring exercises done or nearing completion, the spotlight will soon swivel to how the companies under PNB, the country's largest fund manager, perform post-restructuring. While the exercises were deemed to have unlocked value, which spurred market-beating returns for PNB this year, the question is whether the returns can be sustained in the coming years, after the excitement dies down. \u201cNow that they have the right structure, the boards and the management can focus on their core businesses and get better allocation of capital,\u201d Abdul Wahid said.\u00a0 \u201cWith the transparency of performance, we believe they can improve their fundamental performance. \u201cAt the end of the day, it is about (the strategic companies) immediately growing their earnings, and with higher earnings, they can pay higher dividends (which leads to) higher share prices. So, the focus is on fundamental performance for 2018 onwards,\u201d Abdul Wahid added. The past year has seen conglomerate Sime Darby Bhd carving out its plantation and property businesses to list them as separate entities \u2014 Sime Darby Plantation and Sime Darby Property \u2014 beginning Nov 30. That follows the demerger of UMW Oil and Gas Bhd (UMW-OG) from conglomerate UMW Holdings Bhd via a transfer of UMW\u2019s shareholding in UMW-OG to UMW\u2019s own shareholders. This was completed in July. A similar demerger is in progress in terms of Chemical Company of Malaysia Bhd and its listed subsidiary CCM Duopharma Biotech Bhd, which is slated for completion on Dec 30, according to PNB. On the property front, PNB completed the injection of its privately-held property developer I&P Group Bhd into listed SP Setia Group Bhd on Dec 1, for RM3.65 billion cash. This creates the third-largest Malaysian developer by landbank at roughly 10,000 acres, behind UEM Sunrise Bhd (about 13,000 acres) and Sime Darby Property Bhd (20,763 acres). Separately, on July 31, PNB's wholly-owned property arm PNB Development Sdn Bhd completed the purchase of the 40% it did not own in Seriemas Development Sdn Bhd from Sime Darby Bhd for RM625 million. PNB Development will spearhead PNB\u2019s land banking exercise, going forward, with 9,697 acres of land currently owned, PNB said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done in 2017 had been to address some structural issues. For some of the companies, we felt they are better off being demerged into pure-plays. At the same time, we also believe in strengthening some of the core businesses as well,\u201d Abdul Wahid said on the slew of corporate exercises. Market-beating returns As the corporate exercises unfolded, PNB strategic companies had outperformed the local stock market this year. For example, the collective market value of the three Sime Darby counters is now over RM60.53 billion, nearly 10% higher than the original conglomerate\u2019s RM55.09 billion market capitalisation in December 2016. In the case of SP Setia, its total shareholders' return (TSR) year-to-date is at 21.2% for the past one-year period, according to PNB chief executive officer Datuk Abdul Rahman Ahmad. He said the corresponding TSR in the past couple of years were 5.4% (2016) and 0.2% (2015). Overall, the collective performance of PNB\u2019s strategic companies is twice that of the benchmark FBMKLCI Index, Abdul Rahman said. At the end of trading hours today, the FBMKLCI stood at 1,760.24 points, up 7.22% year-to-date. \u201cIn terms of total shareholders\u2019 return, we delivered 18.1% compared to FBMKLCI\u2019s TSR of 10.3%,\u201d Abdul Rahman said during the briefing. \u201cIn terms of value, we have increased the (total) market capitalisation of these companies by more than RM27 billion.\u201d That had contributed to stronger performance for PNB in 2017, the duo\u2019s first full year at the helm. As at Nov 30, PNB\u2019s net income grew 7.1% y-o-y to RM15.4 billion. It declared a total income distribution of 8.25 sen for its unitholders, or a total of RM10.7 billion. That pay-out comprises 7 sen per unit plus 0.25 sen in bonus dividend out of PNB\u2019s proprietary funds. Another 1 sen will be paid as a special bonus to mark PNB\u2019s 40th anniversary next year, although this anniversary dividend will only be paid for the first 10,000 units held by every unitholder. The corporate restructuring drive was sparked by PNB\u2019s six-year STRIVE-15 plan up to 2020, which aims to enhance corporate returns from PNB\u2019s stable of companies sustainably. The plan was rolled out by Abdul Wahid and Abdul Rahman in November 2016, after they took charge of PNB. It was PNB\u2019s first leadership change in two decades. The plan defines strategic companies, as those where PNB holds majority shareholding. The next layer is its core companies, whereby PNB has 10% or RM1 billion in shareholding value. PNB now has nine strategic companies: Maybank, SP Setia, the Sime Darby companies, UMW companies, reinsurer MNRB Holdings Bhd and Chemical Company of Malaysia Bhd. The Chemical Company of Malaysia demerger will create a tenth. In August, Abdul Wahid told The Edge that PNB will move on to enhance its core companies in collaboration with other shareholders, after the strategic companies\u2019 restructuring is completed. The Malaysian market is the mainstay of PNB\u2019s investments, as over 98% of its asset allocation remains in Malaysia. As at Nov 2017, its asset under management (AUM) has grown 4.6% y-o-y to RM276.5 billion. That pace puts PNB \u201con track\u201d to hitting its 2020 target of RM350 billion in AUM, Abdul Rahman said today. As at Nov 2017, its investments are 70.8% in equities (from 69.9% a year ago); 5.6% in fixed income (Nov 2016: 3.9%); 3.4% in real property (versus 3.3% in Nov 2016); and 2% in private equity (2.6% in Nov 2016). Its cash holdings as of last month made up 17.9% of its assets, a reduction from 19.8% a year ago, as PNB sought to hold less cash and redeploy them into investments."}, "53": {"date_posted": "22/12/2017", "title": "PNB ups 2017 GDP growth forecast to 5.8%", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Dec 22): Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB), the country's largest fund management company, is planning to increase its exposure in the global market next year as the ringgit strengthens. Today, over 90% of its investments are still onshore. \"This question on our international investment portfolio was previously addressed. At the time, the ringgit was not at a favourable position for us to invest overseas,\" its chief executive officer Datuk Abdul Rahman Ahmad told a media briefing to announce PNB's performance for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2017 (FY17). \"[Now] the ringgit has strengthened to (a) level that we can be able to start judiciously investing overseas,\" he said. The ringgit has recovered from 4.49 against the US dollar in early 2017, supported by strong trade surplus and higher commodities prices from a year ago, as well as net foreign inflow for the year 2017. As at 2.40pm today, the ringgit was trading at 4.0845 to the US dollar. PNB is of the view that the local currency may further strengthen to 4.0 against the greenback as at end-2018. PNB chairman Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar said the fund manager has revised Malaysia's 2017 gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast upwards to 5.8% from 5.3% previously, on expectation of continued momentum in 2018. \"Malaysia's GDP growth in 2018 is expected to be between 5% and 5.5%, which will help drive the ringgit higher towards the end of 2018,\" said Abdul Wahid. Increasing its overseas portfolio is just one of several strategies for PNB to grow its assets to RM350 billion while reducing its cash holdings to 12% by 2022, from RM276.5 billion and 17.9% respectively as at end-November 2017. Reuters reported on Nov 16 that PNB sought to increase its presence in private investments, fixed income and property\u00a0\u2014 which is inclusive of landbanking\u00a0\u2014 to support the agenda. With the stronger ringgit providing a foundation for overseas investments, PNB may also be motivated by returns it already received from small investments done in a \"possibly peaking\" US equities market in 2017, said Abdul Rahman. \"A consensus view of 9% to 10% of earnings growth among American corporations certainly looks attractive, but with record highs posted in the US equities market, we will take a conservative approach in anticipation of market corrections,\" he added. It recently disposed of its investment in the Australian property market through the sale of Santos Place in Brisbane for A$370 million or AU$999 per sq ft, he said, adding that the returns will be reinvested into other international properties when the opportunity arises. In the meantime, PNB, with effective presence in a number of Malaysia-listed companies, is seeking to push for organic earnings growth in the companies in 2018. This follows a slew of structural changes that has set the stage for improved evaluation and quality of performance, including the demerger of Sime Darby Group, UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd from parent company UMW Holdings Bhd, as well as Chemical Company of Malaysia Bhd with CCM Duopharma Biotech Bhd \u2014 all of which were completed this year. PNB's private highway concessionaire Projek Lintasan Kota Holdings Sdn Bhd (Prolintas) will also undergo restructuring in 2018, which Abdul Rahman said it is on track for listing in 2019. Abdul Rahman also said PNB will remain invested in Bursa Malaysia as a sign of continued support to the local economic growth. He also urged other Malaysian companies to further drive earnings growth to keep the local stock market attractive to foreign investors. \"Consensus is forecasting a 6% to 7% growth in 2018 corporate earnings. Capital follows performance, which is why we urge Malaysian companies to deliver better performance and continue to attract foreign investors to the Malaysian market,\" he added. The local market has seen foreign outflows in September and October, said Abdul Rahman \u2014 but the year has seen net inflows of some RM11 billion to-date amid the stronger ringgit, coupled with Malaysia's better-than-expected GDP growth trend and expectation of a one-off interest rate hike by Bank Negara Malaysia next year. \u00a0"}, "54": {"date_posted": "20/12/2017", "title": "KLCI rebounds 0.49% as buying gains traction", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Dec 20): The FBM KLCI rebounded and rose 0.49% at mid-morning today as buying sentiment gained traction.

To put into perspective, investors who allocate about a total of RM10,000 to the list or an equal RM1,000 investment in each of the 10 stocks will see a return of about RM1,500 YTD. There were, however, some disappointments as oil and gas companies were not rebounding in line with the recovery in crude oil price at above US$60 (RM244.80) per barrel. Some companies like Gamuda Bhd and Magni-Tech Industries Bhd saw a strong first half, similar to most of the companies on the Bursa Malaysia stock exchange, but, eventually, lost momentum as we entered into the third quarter of the year with negative news flow and disappointing earnings results. Some companies managed to turn around the corner in terms of their financial results but share-price performance continued to disappoint. Export-driven companies like Inari Amertron Bhd continued to outperform with better results and share-price performance. On average, the selection managed to outperform the domestic market but returns were short of impressive when compared with returns of our regional peers, which mostly saw a strong double-digit growth YTD. \u00a0 Inari Amertron Bhd Top performer of the stock picks, Inari maintained its strong performance from 2016 into 2017 as the group continued to see improvements in its earnings. For the group\u2019s financial results for its first quarter of financial year 2018 (1QFY18) ended Sept 30, 2017, its net profit increased by 42.4% to RM68.4 million while its revenue grew by 32.5% to RM373.1 million. It is worth noting that Inari has consistently recorded year-on-year growth of its bottom line since 4QFY16 while it has maintained a double-digit growth for its revenue since 2QFY17. The company, which was selected at the beginning of the year in anticipation of the positive impact from iPhone\u2019s 10th anniversary, has seen a strong and growing demand for premium radio frequency (RF) filters in 2017. According to Kevin Low from Affin Hwang Investment Bank Bhd, Inari\u2019s RF testers have grown to 960 units currently and are projected to reach 1,000 units by year end. Investors who bought into the company at the end of last year would have seen a return of 110.3% from their investment, which is in line with the strong performance among semiconductor and tech-related companies globally. The strong performance is consistent with its annualised return of 100.4% in the last five years. At its closing price of RM3.36 last Friday, the company is trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio (PER) of 26.7 times with an indicated dividend yield of 2.6%. \u2014 By Billy Toh \u00a0 Magni-Tech Industries Bhd The top performer in the first half of 2017 saw its share price fall after the largest original manufacturer for Nike in Malaysia recorded a declining result for both its 1QFY18 ended July 30, 2017 and 2QFY18. Despite the drop, it still manage to record a gain of 41.4% YTD. The garment maker\u2019s 1QFY18 net profit was lower by 16.8% from a year ago at RM19.6 million mainly due to net foreign exchange (forex) loss of RM1.3 million compared to a net forex gain of RM3.4 million in 1QFY17 as well as higher operating expenses such as the impact of higher minimum wages both locally and in Vietnam. The consecutive quarter of lower profit in 2QFY18, where Magni-Tech recorded a lower revenue and net profit, hurt its share price further as it fell by 6.3% to RM5.63 following the announcement of its 2QFY18 results. Inter-Pacific Research\u2019s head of research, Pong Teng Siew, has maintained a \u201cbuy\u201d call on Magni-Tech with a lower target price (TP) of RM6.78. In his report dated Dec 15, Magni-Tech could see its earnings dip in FY18 as wage pressures in Vietnam rise and orders from Nike are affected by sluggish US retail sales growth, a style range rationalisation by 25% starting January next year, Adidas\u2019 market share gains and forex impact from the strengthening of the ringgit. At current levels, Magni-Tech is trading at a trailing PER of about 8.7 times with a dividend yield of about 3.3% and is just short of RM1 billion market capitalisation at RM937.3 million. \u2014 By Billy Toh \u00a0 Gamuda Bhd Gamuda Bhd was selected as one of the top picks for 2017 with expectations of being one of the main beneficiaries from the rollout of new major infrastructure projects in Malaysia, but it saw a relatively quiet year as it only managed a return of about 1.8% YTD. The company had a strong first half this year, which saw a total return of about 14.3% when it closed at an eight-year high of RM5.44 per share. The wave of optimism, however, fizzled out after Mass Rapid Transit Corp Sdn Bhd\u2019s mass rapid transit line 3 (MRT3) tender process required bidders to provide financing for the public rail project. The requirement could rule out any Malaysian contractor being the lead contractor, due to relative balance sheet risks. With the need to provide financing \u2014 the turnkey contractor has to come up with a financing proposal for at least 90% of the project value, which could potentially cost more than RM30 billion and a moratorium for the first eight years \u2014 Gamuda might see its role in MRT3 potentially reduced. As the construction company has historically been the biggest beneficiary due to its project delivery partner role and healthy margins for tunneling, investors reacted negatively to the news flow and caused its share price to fall by 12.9% to RM4.58 on Nov 21 from its closing of RM5.26 on Oct 30. Gamuda is now trading at a trailing PER of 18 times, giving it a market capitalisation of RM11.7 billion. \u2014 By Billy Toh \u00a0 Classic Scenic Bhd Classic Scenic Bhd is the dividend play for our stock pick as it offers a decent dividend yield of about 5.9%. The wooden picture frame manufacturer has a strong operating cash flow to support its dividend payout. While the company\u2019s share-price performance for 2017 has remained subdued with a total return of about 0.24% YTD, long-term investors would still have seen an annualised return of about 18.2% in the past 10 years. The group\u2019s underperformance was mainly due to weaker financial results in its 2QFY17 ended June 30, 2017 and 3QFY17. For its 2QFY17, Classic Scenic\u2019s net profit fell by 6.8% to RM3.4 million from RM3.6 million in the corresponding quarter a year ago mainly due to lower sales revenue. The higher labour costs and operating expenses as a result of lower forex gain on derivatives also hurt its profitability. Similarly, for its 3QFY17, the group\u2019s net profit fell by 8.2% to RM3 million compared with RM3.2 million in 3QFY16. Its management, however, has been positive about consumer spending in the near term on the back of ongoing strength seen in the labour market. In its note filed with Bursa Malaysia, it also shared that the group is making every effort to weather the external challenges by focusing more on development of new marketable products and coming out with other operational improvements. With its strong net cash position of RM22.1 million as at Sept 30 this year, the group remains at a comfortable level to maintain its dividend payout. \u2014 By Billy Toh \u00a0 Protasco Bhd Continuous declining financial results in the current financial year have taken away the optimism of investors on the outlook for Protasco Bhd. Touted as one of the companies to benefit from a possible early 14th general election (GE14) for potentially extra emergency road maintenance work, The Edge Financial Daily listed Protasco as one of the stock picks for the year. However, the company has underperformed in both its financial results and its share price, with a loss of about 3% YTD. The group\u2019s net profit for its 2QFY17 ended June 30, 2017 fell by 45% to RM7.9 million. Similarly, for its 3QFY17, Protasco saw its net profit drop by 28% to RM10.3 million. With the weaker financial results and a lack of news flow on contracts win, Hong Leong Investment Bank Research has downgraded its rating from \u201cbuy\u201d to \u201chold\u201d in its latest report on Nov 30, with a lower TP of RM1.14 from RM1.20. It pointed out that there is a pickup for its road maintenance business as seen in its 3QFY17 and is hopeful that public spending on road maintenance could pick up in the near term as we draw closer to the impending GE14. Despite the weaker performance in 2017, Bloomberg data show that consensus\u2019 TP is at RM1.30, indicating a potential return of 25%. At current levels, Protasco is trading at a trailing PER of 18.3 times, giving it a market capitalisation of RM441.2 million. It also has a decent dividend yield of 5.8%, which is one of the highest among the construction players. \u2014 By Billy Toh \u00a0 Ta Ann Holdings Bhd Sarawak-based Ta Ann Holdings Bhd was selected as one of the stock picks for the year in anticipation of improved demand for timber as well as the turnaround for the plantation sector at the beginning of the year. It, however, saw another disappointing year in 2017 as its share price fell by 7.3% YTD despite the stronger financial results for its first nine months of FY17 (9MFY17) ended Sept 30, 2017. The company\u2019s 9MFY17 net profit edged higher by 2.3% to RM95.8 million from RM93.6 million in 9MFY16, contributed by the better crude palm oil (CPO) and fresh fruit bunch (FFB) average selling prices by 14% and 11% respectively as well as the higher sales volume of 11% and 13% for CPO and FFB respectively. Affin Hwang Investment Bhd analyst, Nadia Aquidah, maintains her \u201cbuy\u201d call on Ta Ann with a TP of RM4.25 as she believes that plantation division earnings growth would be able to partially offset the drop in timber division earnings for 2018. \u201cWe believe it will be a challenging environment going forward for the timber division given an increase in hill timber premium as well as reduction in the export quota,\u201d she said in her report on Nov 28. Bloomberg data show that there are three \u201cbuy\u201d calls and six \u201chold\u201d calls, with an average 12-month TP of RM3.90, indicating a potential return of 9.6% from its current price of RM3.56. At current level, Ta Ann is trading at a trailing PER of 12.8 times, giving it a market capitalisation of RM1.6 billion. \u00a0\u2014 By Billy Toh \u00a0 Sapura Energy Bhd Sapura Energy Bhd was the worst performer among our stock picks for the year with a decline of 51.3% YTD after its share price took a beating recently following the announcement of its results for 3QFY18 ended Oct 31, 2017 that saw a net loss of RM274.4 million. The poorer-than-expected financial performance took place despite the oil price hovering at US$63.26 per barrel as of writing. Recall that Sapura Energy was selected as one of the stock picks for the year as it could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the oil production cut between Opec and non-Opec members. In line with the O&G sector\u2019s recovery theme on improved sentiment following gradual recovery in oil prices, most analysts are optimistic about a turnaround story for Sapura Energy. Bloomberg data show that the average 12-month TP for the group is at about RM1.28, indicating a potential return of 62% from its current price of 78.5 sen. Following the announcement of its financial results as well as the decline in its share price, analysts have made changes to the recommendation with MIDF Research downgrading Sapura Energy to \u201chold\u201d while Kenanga reduced the stock to \u201cunderperform\u201d.

In addition, the progressive launch of the Genting Integrated Tourism Plan also raised expectation of better earnings. Given the fresh growth catalysts, Genting Malaysia was listed as one of The Edge Financial Daily\u2019s stock picks for the year.\u00a0 The return of foreign interest on Bursa Malaysia in the first half of the year helped fuel the share-price rally. The stock started the year on a firm note and it climbed to record-high RM6.14 from RM4.60 \u2014 a strong rally that had not happened in five years, at least. Genting Malaysia, which was once foreign investors\u2019 darling, garnered less attention since some Macau-based casino operators and its sister company Genting Singapore plc were listed in Hong Kong and Singapore respectively.\u00a0 However, the rally lost steam as Genting Malaysia\u2019s earnings performance did not meet expectations in its 2QFY17 ended June 30, 2017 and 3QFY17. Furthermore, foreign selling in the second half of the year dragged the counter to a low of RM4.90, down 20% from the peak. For its 3QFY17, stripping out various exceptional items, Genting Malaysia\u2019s core profit was down by 45% to RM259 million. Analysts noticed that the group\u2019s costs had gone up, such as staff and finance costs, which hurt its profitability. \u2014 By Kathy Fong \u00a0 Sime Darby Bhd The change of guard at Sime Darby Bhd\u2019s controlling shareholder Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) threw the diversified conglomerate into the limelight. Expectation of PNB\u2019s chairman Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar restructuring Sime Darby to unlock asset value prompted many to take a second look at the big-cap counter. In January, Sime Darby announced its restructuring exercise. The conglomerate adopted a \u201cpure play strategy\u201d, breaking the group into three listed entities, namely Sime Darby Bhd, which houses the auto, industrial, logistics and other businesses; Sime Darby Plantation Bhd and Sime Darby Property Bhd. Shares in the plantation and property arms were distributed to shareholders. Meanwhile, both Sime Darby Plantation and Sime Darby Property were listed by introduction on Bursa Malaysia without issuing new shares to raise fresh capital. The listing reference price for Sime Darby Plantation was pegged at RM5.59 while Sime Darby Property\u2019s was RM1.50. Given the renewed interest, Sime Darby\u2019s share price staged a rally, climbing from the RM8-level to a four-year high of RM9.62. If an investor had 1,000 Sime Darby shares at the start of the year, he would have gained about 8.52% as of Dec 15 by holding 1,000 shares in each of Sime Darby listed members now. Sime Darby closed at RM2.12, Sime Darby Plantation RM5.25 and Sime Darby Property RM1.42 last Friday. \u2014 By Kathy Fong \u00a0 Bumi Armada Bhd Bumi Armada Bhd, which is controlled by tycoon Tan Sri Ananda Krishnan, is one of the two O&G stocks among The Edge Financial Daily\u2019s stock picks for the year. The world\u2019s largest floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) operator fell victim to the fierce selldown in the O&G sector for two years, falling from the height of RM2.60 in 2014 to nearly 50 sen late last year. It was hammered down to oversold zone then. Bumi Armada\u2019s share price rebounded this year, although not strongly. It climbed above 80 sen in April; it later hovered in the tight range of between 70 sen and 80 sen in the second half of the year. The improved earnings have lent support to Bumi Armada\u2019s share price. The group returned to the black in its 9MFY17 ended Sept 30, 2017 after it had been loss-making for two years. The group posted a net profit of RM288.4 million, a sharp contrast to a net loss of RM591.6 million in the previous corresponding period. Revenue ballooned almost 44% to RM1.74 billion against RM1.211 billion a year ago. The group\u2019s better performance was mainly boosted by the four major floating production and operation projects, which have been coming online in stages. Bumi Armada\u2019s firm order book as of Sept 30 was approximately RM22.7 billion, with additional optional extensions of up to RM13.1 billion, according to the company\u2019s latest statement on quarterly earnings. \u2014 By Kathy Fong"}, "56": {"date_posted": "11/12/2017", "title": "Execution is key for Sime Darby Property", "article": " AT the close of trading last Thursday, Sime Darby Property Bhd ended at RM1.20 per share, 20% lower than its listing reference price of RM1.50. It is a reflection of the market\u2019s wariness of the soft Malaysian property market at present, says chairman Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar, who sees a compelling investment case for Malaysia\u2019s biggest developer by land bank. \u201cSime Darby Property\u2019s sales and earnings record have been low when benchmarked against its peers. Hence, the selling pressure,\u201d he tells The Edge, adding that the closing price represents a \u201chuge discount of 61%\u201d to its revalued net asset value (RNAV). \u201cShare price aside, the new board and management will focus on improving Sime Darby Property\u2019s fundamental performance,\u201d he says. To be fair, it has been only one day\u2019s trading for the demerged companies that used to form the Sime Darby conglomerate. The spun-off plantation business, now listed as Sime Darby Plantation Bhd, ended 58 sen lower at RM5.01. Sime Darby Bhd rose 27% to RM2.35 per share. For perspective, the case for unlocking value by demerging the conglomerate that was Sime Darby Bhd was not premised on simply breaking up into pure-play companies. The intention was also to create value in the long term, based on greater transparency and increased focus by each individually listed company\u2019s management. In the case of Sime Darby Property, market observers say investors may be waiting to see how well its management can execute plans and deliver value post-listing. The developer is led by managing director Datuk Seri Amrin Awaluddin, a former banker who joined Sime Darby in the middle of this year. Prior to that, he was group managing director of Media Prima Bhd. Datuk Tong Poh Keow, former chief financial officer of the enlarged Sime Darby Bhd, is now executive director and chief financial officer of Sime Darby Property. Board chairman Abdul Wahid is also chairman of Sime Darby\u2019s majority shareholder Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB), where he is driving a huge restructuring across PNB\u2019s major investee companies. Post-listing, PNB controls almost 52% in Sime Darby Property. The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) has 9.51% while Retirement Fund Inc (KWAP) has 5.03%. At the listing ceremony on Thursday, Abdul Wahid remarked that for Sime Darby Property \u2014 as with the other Sime Darby entities \u2014 there will be \u201cnowhere to hide and it will have to benchmark its performance against the likes of Eco World [Development Group] and S P Setia\u201d. The investment case for the developer, however, is \u201ccompelling\u201d to him. \u201cI believe in the long-term prospects and potential for Sime Darby Property on three counts,\u201d he says in a brief reply to The Edge. According to Abdul Wahid, the first is Sime Darby Property\u2019s track record of about 45 years in developing major townships, which totals 23 active townships to date. That is in addition to its role as a partner in London\u2019s Battersea Power Station development alongside S P Setia and the EPF. Secondly, it has the largest land bank among Malaysian developers at 20,763 acres, spanning from Selangor to Johor, he says. The land bank does not include \u201coptions for another 20,000 acres in future growth areas like Malaysia Vision Valley, Iskandar Malaysia and Penang\u201d. The developer previously told investors that the option agreements, entered into with Sime Darby Plantation, are valid for five years from the listing date with an option for a three-year extension. As a comparison, the next largest developer by land bank is UEM Sunrise Bhd, which has about 13,000 acres. S P Setia has 5,218 acres, excluding 4,263 acres owned by I&P Group Sdn Bhd, which PNB is injecting into the developer. Eco World Development Group has 8,052.7 acres, according to its website. Thirdly, it also has a \u201cstrong financial position with shareholders\u2019 funds of RM9.6 billion and low gearing level of 12%. This means that we have the financial strength and flexibility to execute development projects moving forward\u201d, Abdul Wahid says. If the developer successfully leverages these factors with the right execution, there may be attractive upside for the stock, according to CIMB Research. In a Nov 29 note ahead of the listing of the demerged conglomerate, the research house put a target price of RM1.85 per share for Sime Darby Property. Its valuation is based on a 50% discount to the developer\u2019s RNAV, which is larger than CIMB\u2019s usual 20% to 30% discount for blue-chip developers. \u201cSime Darby Property has not been actively developing its land bank, which we believe has resulted in relatively lower returns for its shareholders,\u201d says CIMB, remarking, however, that the developer\u2019s asset value exceeds its market capitalisation despite a \u201cflattish and uninspiring\u201d near-term earnings outlook\u201d. \u201cAs our valuation does not include the potential value enhancement from additional land bank of 20,602 acres under Malaysia Vision Valley option agreements and land option agreements, we see further upside to our RNAV and target price if Sime Darby Property manages to monetise or develop these sites in the future,\u201d the research house says. Moving forward, the spotlight will be on how Sime Darby Property manages its vast land bank. For investors banking on the management to get this aspect right, the investment play in the counter may require a longer-term perspective. \u201cWe are taking a three-pronged approach to take advantage of this huge land bank \u2014 own development of land within and adjacent to our existing core townships/developments and partnering parties who can add value,\u201d says Abdul Wahid, adding that the developer will also look at \u201cmonetisation of a portion of land not within our immediate focus areas\u201d. Abdul Wahid reiterates his confidence that the greater focus, capital allocation and transparency of performance post-demerger will help the three demerged entities do well, \u201cthus creating more value for the shareholders\u201d. \u201cA new beginning indeed for all three entities,\u201d he says. \u00a0"}, "57": {"date_posted": "11/12/2017", "title": "Earnings growth seen in Sime Darby Property\u2019s land bank", "article": " Sime Darby Property Bhd\n(Dec 8, RM1.28)\nInitiate add call with a target price (TP) of RM1.85: Sime Darby Property Bhd is a prominent property developer with the largest land bank in Malaysia as at Sept 2017. Currently, it owns about 20,763 acres (8,402.5ha) of land bank which we estimate has a remaining gross development value (GDV) of RM100.4 billion. The land bank is strategically connected to major highways and located mainly within key growth areas and economic corridors. Sime Darby Property\u2019s land bank within Negeri Sembilan and Johor is strategically located in close proximity to the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail project (HSR). As Seremban and Muar have been identified as transit stops along the rail line, we believe its property projects in the surrounding areas, like Bandar Ainsdale, Seremban, Nilai Impian 1 and Nilai Impian 2 in Negeri Sembilan, as well as Bandar Universiti Pagoh in Muar, will benefit from the development. Sime Darby Property has strategic land bank in and around the area earmarked as the Malaysia Vision Valley (MVV), a component of the government\u2019s 11th Malaysia Plan and the National Transformation Plan. The group currently owns 3,196 acres of land within MVV. While we believe its sizeable reserve of land in MVV will underpin Sime Darby Property\u2019s long-term earnings growth, we also think the development of MVV in the short term will likely help buoy its existing projects in Nilai Impian and Bandar Ainsdale. Following the demerger from Sime Darby Bhd, the group announced a new management team in September, which is tasked with reinventing its growth trajectory. Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar is the chairman, Datuk Sri Amrin Awaluddin is the managing director, and Datuk Datuk Tong Poh Keow is the executive director and chief financial officer. We believe Abdul Wahid\u00a0 is a valuable asset to the group given his vast experience and connections in the public and private sectors. We initiate coverage on Sime Darby Property with an add recommendation. We value the stock based on a 50% discount from our estimate of its revalued net asset valuation, translating into a TP of RM1.85. The large discount compared to an average of 35% for other stocks under our coverage reflects the slower monetisation and longer gestation period of its considerable land bank. We believe the recent share price retracement to 0.8 times the financial year 2018 price-to-book value, which is below peers\u2019 estimates, represents a good opportunity to accumulate the stock. \u2014 CIMB Research, Dec 7"}, "58": {"date_posted": "8/12/2017", "title": "KLCI rises 0.19%, but sellers still lead", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Dec 8): The FBM KLCI rose 0.19% at mid-morning today in line with the regional gains but the broader market sentiment remained edgy with sellers leading gainers.

For 9MFY2017, BAT reported a net profit of RM401.5 million, compared with RM432.95 million in the previous corresponding period \u2014 a year-on-year decline of 7.3%. Earnings came in below consensus estimates, accounting for 67.3% of full-year forecasts, says Hong Leong Investment Bank Research analyst Sheikh Abdullah in an Oct 23 report. \u201cWe cut our FY2017 to FY2019 forecasts by 5% to take into account a lower volume assumption and higher operating expenditure assumptions in anticipation of higher investments in its new brand, Rothmans. \u201cDespite showing signs of improvement, the market share of illicit cigarettes remains high at 56%, thus reinforcing our negative outlook for the sector,\u201d he says. While high excise duties and illicit cigarettes are the main contributors to BAT\u2019s decline, the possibility of the stock being excluded from the benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI index coincides with the plunging share price. On Oct 26, CIMB Investment Bank analyst Ivy Ng Lee Fang noted that the demerger of Sime Darby Bhd into Sime Darby Plantation Bhd and Sime Darby Property Bhd would alter the make-up of the 30-stock FBM KLCI. \u201cOur current break-up market valuations for Sime Darby are: (i) RM44.7 billion for Sime Darby Plantation; (ii) RM13 billion for Sime Darby Property; and (iii) RM10.4 billion for Sime Darby (post-demerger). \u201cAssuming these entities trade in line with our break-up value estimates upon listing, and applying the ground rules, Sime Darby Plantation and Sime Darby Property may be added into the FBM KLCI, and BAT or IJM Corp as well as Sime Darby could be deleted,\u201d says Ng in the report. This report was followed by an Oct 31 note by Phillip Wong of AmResearch, who says: \u201cApart from the potential capital market impact on BAT, we think perpetual regulatory hurdles and disruptive substitute tobacco products do not justify its lofty valuations (forward price-earnings ratio [PER] of 19.8 times versus a historical average of 17.7 times).\u201d At last Thursday\u2019s closing price of RM37.70, BAT\u2019s market capitalisation amounted to RM10.76 billion, making it the smallest stock by market capitalisation on the KLCI. Meanwhile, BAT\u2019s dividends, one of the main selling points for the stock, have been declining on a per share basis since FY2016 as net profit shrinks. Nevertheless, based on its present share price of RM37.70, dividend yield stands at 5.39% \u2014 still a handsome return compared with other stocks on the exchange. It should also be noted that the company has been consistent in its dividend payout ratio over the last few years, paying out more than 95% of earnings. However, the pertinent question now is whether the dividends can be maintained considering the myriad challenges the tobacco industry faces \u2014 from illegal cigarettes to high excise duties. When contacted, a BAT spokesperson tells The Edge that the company is committed to paying dividends above 90% of earnings. To recap, in March last year, BAT announced that it was closing down its manufacturing operations in Malaysia and sourcing its tobacco products for the local market from other manufacturing facilities in the region. \u201cThe restructuring is in line with the group\u2019s efforts to realise a new and more sustainable business model, amid an increasingly challenging business environment,\u201d it says in its 2016 annual report. The land and building in Petaling Jaya was sold in November last year, with the proceeds from the sale going back to shareholders in the form of a special dividend at 46 sen per share in FY2016. As at June 30, the company has successfully transitioned to importing its tobacco products and ceased domestic production of cigarettes. The shift to fully importing its tobacco products seems to have paid off. Gross margins for its third quarter ended Sept 30, 2017 (3QFY2017), improved to 36.5% from 34.7% a year earlier. BAT recently entered the value-for-money (VFM) segment with its new product, Rothmans. The price of the cigarettes, which retail at RM12 per pack, is below its Peter Stuyvesant and Pall Mall (RM15.50 each) brands and its premium brand, Dunhill (RM17 per pack). Analysts are generally positive on BAT\u2019s move into the VFM segment as it is the fastest-growing product segment. \u201cThis allows BAT to compete with its peers in this segment, especially to capture customers with lower affordability and narrow the pricing difference between its products versus illicit cigarettes,\u201d says a CIMB Research report. Although the move to the VFM segment has been touted as necessary, some analysts say it could result in the cannibalisation of its premium Dunhill brand and consequently, the dilution of revenue growth and margins. \u201cWe believe this will drag down its overall margins, given that VFM products have lower margins versus products in other segments. On top of that, we believe that this will also lead to the cannibalisation of market share of its higher margin product segments,\u201d says CIMB Research. For 3QFY2017, BAT\u2019s net profit fell 32.7% to RM143.18 million from a year ago, while revenue shrank 18.8% to RM757.28 million. The weakness comes on the back of lower sales volume, higher operating cost from the expenses of a new product range and an elevated level of illegal cigarettes in the market. As at August, BAT reported that illegal cigarettes stood at 56.1% of the market, a slight decline from 58.9% in April. Nevertheless, BAT\u2019s market share declined to 53.9% in 3QFY2017 from 54.5% in the second quarter. It is worth noting that BAT\u2019s sales volume declined 1.7% quarter on quarter, even though the broader market grew 3%, highlights AmInvestment Research. That said, many analysts believe that the proliferation of illegal cigarettes and the tight regulatory controls on the tobacco industry will continue to weigh down the company. There are five \u201cbuy\u201d, 10 \u201chold\u201d and four \u201csell\u201d calls on BAT, according to Bloomberg data, with an average target price of RM43.42. BAT is trading at a PER of 15.35 times. \u00a0"}, "68": {"date_posted": "8/11/2017", "title": "F&N, Mah Sing, Red Ideas, RHB, LBS Bina, Goh Ban Huat, Malaysian Pacific Industries, UEM Edgenta, Eco World International and Sime Darby", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 8): Based on corporate announcements and news flow today, companies in focus on Thursday (Nov 9) may include: Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd, Mah Sing Group Bhd, Red Ideas Holdings Bhd, RHB Bank Bhd, LBS Bina Group Bhd, Goh Ban Huat Bhd, Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd, UEM Edgenta Bhd, Eco World International Bhd and Sime Darby Bhd Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd is expecting to see improvement in both revenue and profit in its financial year ending Sept 30, 2018 (FY18), as its capacity-building and cost reduction measures initiated this year is near completion.

F&N saw net profit decline 16.09% to RM323.38 million in FY17, from RM385.37 million, dragged mainly by one-off restructuring costs totalling RM48.4 million, comprising mostly of voluntary separation scheme costs incurred when rescaling its workforce. Operating profit declined 20.4% to RM345.1 million. Mah Sing Group Bhd said construction of its RM937 million D'sara Sentral mixed development here is ahead of schedule by 12 to 15 months, after the project clocked over four million safe man-hours without any lost time injury.

More than a month after selling a 51% stake in Goh Ban Huat Bhd (GBH) to Paragon Adventure Sdn Bhd, Tan Sri Robert Tan Hua Choon is resigning as the group's non-independent and non-executive chairman. Tan, who has been chairman of the ceramic and sanitary ware company since 2010, is relinquishing his position due to the change in the controlling shareholder, GBH said in its filing with the stock exchange. However, the tycoon still holds a 12.82% equity interest in the company and 24.83% of its outstanding warrants, GBH said. Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd (MPI) said its net profit fell 8.7% to RM36.24 million for its first financial quarter ended Sept 30, 2017, from RM39.72 million a year earlier, mainly due to higher material cost arising and higher commodity price. However, quarterly revenue inched up 8.3% to RM387.63 million from RM358 million. MPI has declared a higher first interim single tier dividend of 10 sen per share to be paid on Dec 8, compared with 8 sen previously. UEM Edgenta Bhd is claiming RM23.76 million in damages from another firm in relation to two road construction and upgrading jobs. UEM Edgenta said its wholly-owned subsidiary Edgenta Propel Bhd (Propel) is demanding the amount from Hartajaya-Benteng Timur-AMR Jeli JV Sdn Bhd (HBT), following a court decision on the matter on Aug 29. UEM Edgenta said that between Aug 2009 and June 2010, HBT awarded two contracts to Edgenta Propel, comprising construction of a new expressway from Seremban-Port Dickson-FR5, and upgrading the road from FR5 from Pasir Panjang to Linggi, Negeri Sembilan. Later, Edgenta Propel decided to halt work under the contracts due to non-payment by HBT of the outstanding contracts sum of RM16.12 million and RM6.41 million respectively.

After the demerger was announced in January, Sime Darby\u2019s share price rose as much as 18% to touch a 3\u00bd-year intra-day high of RM9.70 in June before seeing a correction to RM9 at end-August. Upon the completion of the three-way split, Sime Darby Plantation Bhd will be the second largest plantation player in Malaysia, accounting for 304,867ha or 5.3% of total planted area in Malaysia, after Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd. Although the demerger is drawing near \u2014 in late November or early December \u2014 there has not been much activity in Sime Darby\u2019s shares. The counter has been hovering at the RM9 level while trading since early September has remained largely under the 200-day average volume of 8.01 million shares as investors take a wait-and-see stance on the proposed split. Last Thursday, the stock closed at RM9.08, giving the company a market capitalisation of RM61.75 billion. \u201cI believe Sime Darby Plantation will continue to do well as it is not affected by the shortfall in the other operations. The reason for the lack of interest in Sime Darby\u2019s shares could be concerns about Sime Darby Property and the other businesses that will be left under Sime Darby,\u201d says an analyst. \u201cThe property side has recorded a lot of gains on disposal, which if excluded would actually make the operation loss-making.\u201d In the fourth quarter of the financial year ended June 30, 2017 (4QFY2017), the property division saw a 32% year-on-year drop in operating profit to RM801 million. The decline was attributed to lower gains from the asset monetisation of RM542 million compared with RM671 million a year earlier and lower gains from compulsory land acquisition of RM58 million versus RM145 million in the previous year. However, an improvement in the operation is possible following the appointment of Permodalan Nasional Bhd group chairman Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar as the chairman of Sime Darby Property and former Media Prima Bhd group managing director Datuk Seri Amrin Awaluddin as the property arm\u2019s managing director. But it will most likely take time. \u201cTo be fair, they want to demerge so management can be more focused. So perhaps it could improve after the demerger. But the question is, can they execute it?\u201d the analyst asks. Public Investment Bank Bhd (PIVB) analyst Chong Hoe Leong has a more positive view of the demerger, forecasting value creation of between RM5 billion and RM6 billion upon the completion of the exercise. This is equivalent to a 9% to 10% improvement from the current structure. PIVB has an \u201coutperform\u201d call on Sime Darby with a target price of RM9.72. Chong believes Sime Darby Property has upside potential as it has 16,398 acres of strategically located land bank in the Klang Valley, Negeri Sembilan and Johor with a total estimated gross development value of RM101 billion. Moreover, he says, the property arm has access to an additional land bank of 11,806 acres through land option agreements. The potential pick-up in the local property market could also lift valuations, he adds. Value will also come from Sime Darby Plantation\u2019s plan to improve its oil extraction rate and fresh fruit bunch yield. \u201cThey are planning to improve the OER to 25% and FFB yield to 25 tonnes per hectare, which will create value after the merger,\u201d says Chong. \u201cThey are also doing some aggressive replanting to improve the age profile. The yield improvement will come gradually, though, as they only aim to achieve these targets by 2025.\u201d As for the lack of investor interest, he says, \u201cSime Darby is currently trading at around RM9 to RM9.10 and we still have more than a month to go before the demerger. Interest will probably rise when we get closer to the completion date of the exercise. Value creation will only be realised after the demerger, after all.\u201d Another analyst, however, says Sime Darby\u2019s FFB yield per hectare is lower than that of big-cap plantation players, such as Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd (KLK), although the former has a higher price-earnings ratio. \u201cOperationally, their FFB yield per hectare is below KLK\u2019s but their PER is higher. After the demerger, the PER will roll back to average plantation levels. There is no good reason for the premium.\u201d According to Bloomberg data, Sime Darby was trading at a PER of 33.02 times compared with KLK\u2019s 22.94 times and IOI Corp Bhd\u2019s 38.42 times. When Sime Darby announced its plan to create three standalone businesses early this year, its chairman, Tan Sri Mohd Bakke Salleh, said the plantation and property divisions were on a sound financial footing and better equipped to be listed as pure plays. He said the demerger was a crucial step to achieve the original aspirations of the shareholders in 2007, when Sime Darby was created from the merger of Golden Hope Plantations Bhd, Kumpulan Guthrie Bhd and Kumpulan Sime Darby Bhd. According to analyst reports, Sime Darby revealed more details of the pure plays at a shareholders\u2019 engagement last month. The company had said the plantation arm would focus on growing organically, aiming to improve its FFB yield to 25 tonnes per hectare (from 19 tonnes per hectare now) and OER to 25% (from 21.3% now) by FY2025. Sime Darby Plantation will also strive to lower production costs in its upstream division by maintaining its aggressive replanting activity, improving its irrigation system and increasing mechanisation in its operations. It aims to increase the pre-tax profit contribution of its downstream division by focusing on differentiated, sustainable and traceable high-value products and building its presence in key markets. Meanwhile, Sime Darby Property will concentrate on growing its recurring income contribution to 10% of its operating profit by FY2022 by increasing its portfolio of income-generating assets, developing its existing land bank and expanding its overseas property development footprint by leveraging its involvement in Battersea Power Station in London. Sime Darby will zero in on the motor and industrial businesses. Upon the demerger, Sime Darby Plantation and Sime Darby Property will have dividend policies of paying out a minimum 50% and 20% of profits respectively. The final prospectuses and circulars are expected to be released by end-October or early November before the listing of the two units by early December. \u00a0"}, "70": {"date_posted": "6/10/2017", "title": "Be selective in buying plantation stocks as CPO price tapers off, say analysts ", "article": " HAVING climbed strongly since the end of June, crude palm oil prices may ease to trade between RM2,500 and RM2,800 per tonne for the rest of the year, say analysts. CPO came off its previous high of RM2,849 recorded on Feb 17 to close at RM2,737 per tonne last Thursday as traders sold on forecasts of lower prices in the coming months. Leading industry analyst Dr James Fry said on Sept 13 that the price of the edible oil is expected to decline 17% by November to December. Another palm oil price forecaster, Thomas Mielke, while not as bearish, sees CPO trading at around RM2,600 per tonne or below in the final quarter of the year due to improved palm oil production, which will raise the inventory level. Analysts are recommending that investors be selective about the plantation stocks they want to buy amid weakening CPO prices. CIMB Investment Bank regional head of plantations Ivy Ng expects palm oil production to increase in the remaining months of the year, pushing up the stockpile and putting downward pressure on prices amid rising soybean oil inventory level. \u201cIf production continues to increase, CPO prices may taper off. Our message to investors is that we don\u2019t think the stock level of palm oil has peaked,\u201d she tells The Edge over the telephone. Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) data shows that the palm oil stockpile reached 1.94 million tonnes in August \u2014 the highest since February last year when the inventory level stood at 2.17 million tonnes. Ng, who has assigned an \u201cadd\u201d rating and a target price of RM10 to Sime Darby Bhd, says CPO will be trading between RM2,500 and RM2,800 per tonne by end-September. In a Sept 12 note to clients, she says she likes Sime Darby because she expects its share price to be re-rated on the back of higher commodity prices and on its plan to demerge its plantation and property divisions and list them separately. RHB Research regional head of plantations Hoe Lee Leng expects CPO prices to drop to a low of RM2,500 per tonne over the rest of the year. \u201cMaybe CPO will hit RM2,500 per tonne in the fourth quarter because of the growing production and stock levels. I expect 2017 to be a bumper year as planters ramped up production after the El Ni\u00f1o drought last year,\u201d she says. Of the 11 plantation counters she covers, Hoe has a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on Sarawak Oil Palms Bhd (SOP) and CB Industrial Product Holding Bhd (CBIP) with a target price of RM4.20 and RM2.40 respectively. Areca Capital Sdn Bhd CEO Danny Wong also likes SOP and CBIP as their earnings visibility is higher than that of their peers. \u201cWe prefer to look at companies whose business is simpler than that of bigger (plantation) groups as their earnings are easier to predict. \u201cIt is not simple to analyse plantation counters as there are many factors to consider. CPO price is one of the important factors but this does not necessarily mean that it correlates with the earnings of palm oil producers. It depends on the timing of their acquisition of inventory as well,\u201d he says. Wong also doubts that the current strength of CPO prices is sustainable in the long term as demand is weakening. According to MPOB data, palm oil exports in August declined 18.5% year on year to 1.49 million tonnes but climbed 6.43% from 1.4 million tonnes in July. MIDF Research plantation analyst Alan Lim, meanwhile, is relatively positive about near-term CPO prices. \u201cWe note that September inventory in Malaysia will rise 7% to 2.08 million tonnes. However, the price of CPO should be supported at above RM2,700 per tonne throughout the fourth quarter of this year as long as the soybean oil price remains above US$725 per tonne or about US$0.33 per pound on the Chicago Board of Trade,\u201d he says. \u201cWe think the soybean oil price should remain high due to low production in the US and South America. The ceiling for CPO is RM2,950 per tonne as we think that most producers will sell forward significantly once the price climbs towards RM3,000 per tonne.\u201d Apart from Lim, leading edible oils industry analyst, Dorab Mistry, is also bullish about CPO prices, predicting that the commodity will trade between RM2,600 and RM3,000 per tonne by January next year as long as the Malaysian stockpile remains below 2.6 million tonnes. CIMB\u2019s Ng believes that the stockpile of soybean oil, the main substitute for palm oil, is also high. \u201cThe stock level of soybean oil, as it currently stands, is quite high and the new crop in the US is also doing okay,\u201d she says. RHB\u2019s Hoe concurs, saying that the soybean oil inventory is considered to be in surplus now unless a disaster or typhoon affects production. \u201cSo far, the hurricanes in the US have not affected the soy fields.\u201d Meanwhile, Lim says he likes selected themes like high fresh fruit bunch (FFB) growth. \u201cTake Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd. We expect its FFB growth for the financial year ending Sept 30, 2017, to be at least 10%. This would be the highest among all index-linked plantation stocks, including IOI Corp Bhd and Sime Darby.\u201d Lim has a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on KLK with a target price of RM29.25. Among non-index-linked stocks, Lim likes TSH Resources Bhd. He has a \u201cbuy\u201d call on the stock with a target price of RM2.15 as he expects the group\u2019s FFB growth in the financial year ending Dec 31, 2017, to be 16%."}, "71": {"date_posted": "4/10/2017", "title": "Sime Darby pure plays get SC nod for syariah-compliant securities", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Oct 4): Sime Darby Bhd\u2019s plantation and property arms have received the Securities Commission Malaysia's (SC) approval for the classification of their shares as syariah-compliant securities.

Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd's second quarter net profit jumped 96% to RM246.34 million, from RM125.43 million a year earlier, mainly due to lower finance costs on the back of favourable unrealised foreign exchange gains.

Topline for the period also came in 12% higher at RM2.03 billion compared with RM1.81 billion a year ago. The property developer achieved total sales of RM772 million in the third quarter ended July 31 (3QFY17), 40% stronger than the RM552 million it posted in 2QFY17. Meanwhile, Eco World International Bhd's (EWI) net loss narrowed to RM24.2 million in the third quarter ended July 31, 2017 (3QFY17) from RM46.4 million in the previous corresponding period, thanks to stronger British pound. Quarterly revenue came in at RM97,000 versus RM288,000 in 3QFY16. The group, which was listed on April 3 this year, recorded a net loss of RM55.1 million in the cumulative nine-month period ended July 31, 2017 (9MFY17), which is 66.6% lower than RM165 million in the prior year, while revenue slipped 7.8% to RM461,000 in 9MFY17 from RM500,000 a year ago. \u00a0 \u00a0"}, "73": {"date_posted": "11/9/2017", "title": "Sime Darby unveils board line-up for plantation, property pure plays", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Sept 11): Sime Darby Bhd has announced the board of directors line-up for its pure plays, Sime Darby Plantation Bhd and Sime Darby Property Bhd, which will comprise 11 directors to each board upon the listing of the units. \"The new members of the two boards and the senior management have the experience and expertise, to spearhead the businesses in these challenging times. \"We are confident they will grow the companies into stronger entities to generate sustainable returns for all stakeholders,\" said current Sime Darby chairman Tan Sri Abdul Ghani Othman in a statement today.

The news, which could see the project being put on hold, came as Westports Holdings Bhd was given the green light about a week ago for the RM10 billion development of Container Terminals 10 to 19. \u201cThe decision by the government on the Carey Island port is negative and indicates a reluctance on its part to pursue it,\u201d says a source with a logistics company. Another source, a port official who knows the details, says he is not the least bit surprised as there were many flaws in the plan to build the Carey Island terminal. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make sense from the start.\u201d It seems there are many reasons for shelving the Carey Island plan. For starters, MMC Port Holdings Sdn Bhd, a unit of MMC Corp Bhd, is partnering India\u2019s largest private port operator, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ), on this development. The other party involved is Sime Darby Bhd, which has large tracts on Carey Island. Initially, it seems there was a search for a Chinese partner but the talks fell through as the Chinese only wanted to carry out the construction and little else without control of the terminal. The attention then shifted to India, but terminals are not its strong point.\u00a0 Last year, the throughput for the whole country amounted to a mere 12.53 million 20-foot equivalent units, or TEUs. In contrast, Port Klang alone handled 13.17 million TEUs in 2016, and Malaysian ports collectively would have handled in excess of 16 million TEUs. \u201cSo, there was a question mark over how APSEZ could assist MMC in the development of the Carey Island port ... it doesn\u2019t even seem as qualified as Northport,\u201d says one of the sources. Northport (M) Bhd is wholly owned by MMC, and together with Westports, makes up\u00a0 Port Klang. To recap, MMC, Sime Darby Property Bhd and APSEZ signed a memorandum of understanding to study the feasibility of developing an integrated maritime city on Carey Island in April this year. The three companies, in a joint statement, said the maritime city was aimed at supporting the development of a new port on Carey Island, a greenfield site. Others also questioned the choice of APSEZ, which is listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange of India. While it has been successful in dealing with commodities, it has no experience in greenfield container ports. A port official points out that shipping lines are already entrenched in either Singapore, Port of Tanjung Pelepas or Port Klang and getting them to shift would be difficult as it would involve dropping rates. It also does not help that mixed signals are being sent by Melaka. Initially, there was talk of a container port being developed there, and later on, a cruise terminal. Now, a liquid cargo facility is being mulled. The deepsea port for liquid cargo in Melaka, estimated to cost RM8 billion, is part of the larger RM30 billion Malacca Gateway project \u2014 a 1,350-acre mixed-use development project on three reclaimed islands and one natural island in the Strait of Malacca. Some agreements, including with Powerchina International Group Ltd, have been inked, but most port executives agree that Pengerang in Johor would be the ideal choice for a liquid cargo terminal. \u201cTalk to any shipping company official and they will tell you it doesn\u2019t make sense. The fact that the plans for the port switched from container initially to cruise, and now to liquid cargo, says a lot. Were any studies done to see what can be built? \u201cClearly, the depth (about 20m to 25 m) makes it ideal for submarines, but the possible use of the port in Malacca for military purposes has not been addressed,\u201d says the port official. The Carey Island port development is just one of the handful of infrastructure projects that have drawn scrutiny.\u00a0 Others include the RM55 billion East Coast Railway Line (ECRL), which would involve the construction of a 620km electrified rail link between Kuantan Port and Port Klang, and the expansion of Kuantan Port. \u00a0"}, "75": {"date_posted": "16/8/2017", "title": "KLK, Batu Kawan decline after posting weaker 3Q profits", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 16): Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd (KLK) fell 20 sen or 0.81% to RM24.48 per share at mid-morning today, after posting a 53.8% decline in its third quarter (3QFY17) net profit, due to losses in its manufacturing segment. The conglomerate, which has also business activities in the plantations and oleochemicals, was among the top three decliners on thin trades of 47,300 as at 11.20am. Its year-to-date net profit (9MFY17) of RM801.03 million, which saw a reduction of 37.5% year-on-year, had come in below consensus expectations at 65%. This led to cuts in target prices by TA Securities and Public Invest Research to RM26.18 per share and RM25.18 per share respectively. CIMB Research, which maintained a \u201cHold\u201d rating on the stock with an unchanged target price of RM27.15, said it remains positive on the plantations division due to expected higher fresh fruit bunches production. \u201cHowever, the group expects its oleochemical division to report lower profit in FY17, due to the write-down in the value of its stocks in 3QFY17, as well as the challenging and competitive market environment,\u201d CIMB head of equity research for Malaysia, Ivy Ng, wrote in a report yesterday. Another plantations giant, Batu Kawan Bhd, was also traded down some 14 sen or 0.74% to RM18.86 per share, on some 27,600 shares traded. Batu Kawan had also posted a decline in its third quarter (3QFY17) net profit by 46% yesterday, to RM80.78 million. Other plantation counters that topped the morning\u2019s decliners were United Plantations Bhd, Genting Plantations Bhd and Sime Darby Bhd. United Plantations had lost some 18 sen or 0.64% to RM27.9 per share, while Genting Plantations was down 8 sen or 0.76% at RM10.50 per share. Meanwhile, Sime Darby was down 5 sen at RM9.33 per share. This is likely due to expected weaker export numbers and the recent decline in crude palm oil prices, which saw Malaysian palm oil futures fall yesterday to RM2,633, its sharpest drop in a week, said Kenanga Research analyst Voon Yee Ping."}, "76": {"date_posted": "2/8/2017", "title": "Analysts positive on Sime Darby's Seriamas stake disposal", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Aug\u00a02): Analysts are generally positive on the news of Sime Darby\u2019s disposal of its 40% stake in Seriamas Development Sdn Bhd (SDSB) to Permodalan Nasional Bhd yesterday for RM625 million cash, despite the lack of details surrounding the transaction. Sime Darby told Bursa Malaysia yesterday that it expected to record a gain on disposal (after non-controlling interests) of approximately RM305 million. The conglomerate said its original cost of investment in SDSB is RM449 million and that proceeds from the disposal will mainly be used for general corporate purposes and working capital, including repayment of borrowings. Sime Darby said the disposal consideration represents a discount of 39.4% to the realisable net asset value (RNAV) of SDSB of RM1.23 million as at March 31, 2017. PublicInvest Research said in a note today that it had no details on the specific location and balance of landbank size held after the disposal, making details of the transaction still unclear. \u201cAs details of the transaction remain sketchy, it is relatively difficult to give our view on this deal,\u201d PublicInvest Research said. However, it maintained its outperform call on the stock, with an unchanged target price of RM9.72. RHB Research Institute Sdn Bhd however said in its note today that it considers the valuation for the transaction to be relatively inexpensive, but the value-unlocking for the deal is progressing. \u201cAssuming the hotels and malls have zero value (given location and size), we estimate that Sime is disposing its stake in SDSB for around RM4.48 per square foot (psf). This is in comparison to recent land transactions in Selangor that were closer to RM5psf,\u201d it said. \u201cNevertheless, we would consider this disposal as a positive development. This is due to the fact that Sime\u2019s landbank held under associates is not even included in our RNAV calculation for Sime\u2019s property assets of RM20.3billion. As such, any disposal of such landbank would be additional value unlocking for the company,\u201d it added. Sime Darby said the disposal in SDSB is expected to be completed by year end, which is also when the group expects to list its property and plantation arms. RHB however said the market should wait for more details on the upcoming listing structure of its property arm Sime Darby Property Bhd. \u201cAlthough Sime\u2019s share price has already risen by more than 20% from its low, we believe the market should wait for more news on the upcoming listing structure and earnings growth drivers in the interim period,\u201d RHB said. Meanwhile, CIMB IB Research said in a flash note yesterday that it is positive on the news and believes the transaction price is \u201cfair\u201d, as the implied discount of the implied equity value to RNAV is in line with precedent transactions of Malaysian property companies over the past three years, which range from 26.1% to 45.9%. The research house said Sime\u2019s original cost of investment in SDSB was RM449 million. \u201cWe are positive on this news, as we expect Sime to record a gain on disposal of RM305 million from the disposal, after netting off non-controlling interests and cost of disposal,\u201d CIMB IB Research said. \u201cWe expect the gain to be recognised in FY16/18, and this could bump up Sime\u2019s net profit by 13% or earnigns per share (EPS) by 4.48 sen per share. We have not incorporated this into our earnings forecasts, pending the completion of the deal,\u201d it added.

Media Prima Bhd and Hong Leong Industries Bhd have announced that their associated company, Malaysian Newsprint Industries Sdn Bhd (MNI), has initiated creditors' voluntary winding up proceedings. In separate filings to Bursa Malaysia, the two groups said MNI has appointed Lim San Peen of PricewaterhouseCoopers Advisory Services Sdn Bhd as the interim liquidator of the exercise. \"The board of MNI was of the opinion that MNI could not continue its business. MNI had been operating under very difficult market conditions, especially declining newsprint demand, and has incurred losses for the past three years,\" said Media Prima and Hong Leong Industries.

Meanwhile, Hong Leong Industries and Norwegian company Norse Skog Papers (M) Sdn Bhd each has a 33.65% stake in MNI, while another investor, Rimbunan Hijau Group \u2014 which is controlled by Sarawak billionaire Tan Sri Tiong Hiew King, owns an 11.34% stake. Sunway Bhd has acquired two freehold plots \u2014 a 14.8-acre freehold land in USJ 1, Subang Jaya, for RM167.59 million and a 5.28-acre one in Kajang for RM63 million. The land in USJ was purchased from Premier Place Property Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bursa Malaysia-listed Jaks Resources Bhd. Sunway will be using the land in USJ for warehousing and storage facilities for its trading manufacturing businesses upon acquisition, but will look to subsequently redevelop the land into a proposed mixed development with a gross development value (GDV) of approximately RM1.4 billion in the next five years. As for the Kajang land, it was purchased from Concept Housing Development (M) Sdn Bhd and comes with semi-completed structures which are part of a previously approved development whose construction had been discontinued. Sunway intends to continue building on the semi-completed structures but will replace the development with a proposed mixed-development comprising a retail podium or commercial lots and serviced apartments or Small Office Home Office (SOHO) with an estimated GDV of RM460 million in the next five years. The USJ and Kajang land acquisitions follow Sunway's earlier purchase of a parcel of freehold land measuring 4.53 acres in Jalan Belfield, Kuala Lumpur, less than a month ago and the acquisition of 8.45 acres in Jalan Peel in February. Cumulatively, in the last six months, the developer has acquired four plots of strategic land with GDV of RM5 billion. Tatt Giap Group Bhd is disposing of 41% of its 51% stake in Tatt Giap Steel Centre Sdn Bhd (TGSC) to Japanese steel player Hanwa Co Ltd for RM12.3 million. Hanwa, which is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Osaka Stock Exchange, already holds a 15% equity interest in TGSC and the acquisition of the 41% stake will see its shareholding rise to 56%. Tatt Giap said the stake disposal enables the group to unlock its investment in TGSC, realise its value, and thus strengthen its financial position. Paramount Corp Bhd's wholly-owned subsidiary plans to dispose of its private and international schools, Sekolah Sri KDU and Sri KDU International School, to newly-formed Alpha Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) for RM165 million. The proposed disposal is in line with Paramount's aim to pursue an asset light strategy and monetise its real estate assets through a sale-leaseback transaction. Paramount said Sri KDU Sdn Bhd entered into a master agreement and triple net lease with Alpha REIT to dispose of the properties in Pekan Baru, Sungai Buloh in Selangor. The sale-leaseback enables it to unlock capital resources from being tied up in long-term assets by providing growth capital, while allowing it to focus on its core activities that would reward shareholders better. Paramount said proceeds from the proposed sale, expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2017, would be used to cut back on leverage for the group (RM113 million), reward shareholders (RM31.8 million) and for working capital (RM19.7 million). Meanwhile, Paramount's sale-leaseback with Alpha REIT marks the start of the first education REIT in the country. In a statement, Alpha REIT chairman Datuk Stewart LaBrooy said it expects a second acquisition of an international school at RM140 million in a month. Sime Darby Bhd is disposing of its 40% stake in Seriemas Development Sdn Bhd to Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) for RM625 million cash to monetise the seller's real estate assets. \"The proposed disposal is in line with Sime Darby's strategy to unlock value through monetisation and opportunistic divestments, while enabling Sime Darby to reduce its borrowings via the proceeds from the proposed disposal.

However, the process of selecting a master developer has not been a smooth one. The development agreement with the initial master developer \u2014 a consortium comprising Iskandar Waterfront Holdings Sdn Bhd and China Railway Engineering Corp (M) Sdn Bhd \u2014 has lapsed and the Ministry of Finance recently issued a new request for proposals to fill the role. Despite the delay, Bandar Malaysia is seen as a game changer for the area due to its planned public transport network. It will have two mass rapid transit (MRT) Line 2 stations and will be one of the stops on the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail (HSR) line. A beneficiary of the mega project is Chan Sow Lin, its low-profile neighbour located off Jalan Sungai Besi. The area is slowly being transformed, thanks to heightened interest from developers, and has seen a rise in property transactions and new projects. Transformations Jalan Chan Sow Lin cleaves the area into an east and a west side, bounded by Sungai Kerayong and Jalan Sungai Besi respectively. Named after one of the founding fathers of modern Kuala Lumpur, it has a mix of leasehold and freehold land. Landmarks include Percetakan Nasional Malaysia Bhd\u2019s premises, the Chan Sow Lin light rail transit (LRT) station and Southgate Commercial Centre. Datuk Ganesan, chairman of the Kuala Lumpur Wilayah Persekutuan Chan Sow Lin landowners and businessmen association, says the area has seen much transformation over the past 20 years, with various land acquisitions for infrastructure purposes. Ganesan \u2014 who is also the executive chairman and director of Revolution Glory Property Sdn Bhd, which mainly deals with land-related matters \u2014 owns several parcels, with a total size of eight acres, in Chan Sow Lin. With the lifting of the height restriction for buildings following the relocation of the airbase, he has seen approvals given for properties with more than 50 floors. This provides more flexibility in planning future developments. \u201cMost of the land on the west side has been converted from industrial to commercial status, while the east mainly remains industrial land. We believe these will be converted into commercial land sooner or later,\u201d says Ganesan. Chan Sow Lin is now home to many 3S (sales, service and spare parts) and 4S (sales, service, systems and spare parts) centres for brands such as Peugeot, Mitsubishi, Hyundai-Sime Darby, Naza Kia and Proton Edar. There are various ongoing and upcoming developments, including the 14-storey hybrid commercial hub The Trax \u2014 jointly being developed by Insan Tiara Sdn Bhd and Utusan Melayu (M) Bhd \u2014 and apartment project One Residences Kuala Lumpur by Akisama Group as well as mixed-use development Trion Kuala Lumpur by Binastra Land Sdn Bhd. City & Country went to the rooftop of Wisma Mah Sing \u2014 the headquarters of property developer Mah Sing Group Bhd, which is located diagonally across from Southgate Commercial Centre \u2014 to get an aerial view of Chan Sow Lin. From there, one can see new projects sprouting between the old industrial buildings. KGV-Lambert Smith Hampton (M) Sdn Bhd director Anthony Chua says Chan Sow Lin is one of the oldest industrial areas in Kuala Lumpur. \u201cWith practically no new industrial properties being built in Kuala Lumpur, demand for industrial properties here has always been high.\u201d The stock stands at 5,138 units as at the first half of last year and there is no incoming supply, according to data from the National Property Information Centre. Land prices in Chan Sow Lin have shot up, says Ganesan. He adds that land there now cost more than RM500 psf, compared with RM250 to RM300 psf in 2012, about RM130 psf in 2007 and 2008, and RM50 psf in 2003 and 2004. While property consultants are envisioning a transformation for the area \u2014 from an industrial enclave into a modern neighbourhood \u2014 it will probably take some time for the change to happen as the lots are owned by different owners. The future development of Chan Sow Lin, they believe, may be more on a piecemeal basis rather than an integrated one. PA International Property Consultants (KL) Sdn Bhd managing director Jerome Hong says land fronting Jalan Sungai Besi is categorised under \u201cneighbourhood centre commercial or mixed use commercial\u201d with a plot ratio of 1:2 and 1:6 respectively, according to the Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan 2020. \u201cThere are also plans by Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur to transform Chan Sow Lin into the city\u2019s state-of-the-art automobile business park, housing companies supplying parts to businesses associated with the automobile industry, such as accessory dealers, car showrooms and vehicle-servicing workshops. The transformation of Chan Sow Lin continues, albeit at a slower pace, amid the slowdown in the economy and prevailing slow property market condition,\u201d says Hong. According to Ganesan, Chan Sow Lin has seen land acquisitions in the past for the construction of the Stormwater Management And Road Tunnel (SMART Tunnel), Maju Expressway and Besraya Expressway. Upcoming land acquisitions there will be for the development of the MRT Line 2 and Duta Ulu-Kelang Expressway Phase 3 (DUKE 3), he says, adding that land acquisitions for DUKE 3 will affect the first row of properties facing Jalan Chan Sow Lin and some properties in Jalan Empat. Part of DUKE 3 will run on Jalan Chan Sow Lin and Jalan Empat. Catalysts Hong believes Bandar Malaysia is one of the catalysts for the redevelopment of Chan Sow Lin as the former is planned as a world-class, sustainable city within a city that offers quality living next to a vibrant international business hub \u2014 the Tun Razak Exchange (TRX) \u2014 and a tourism and lifestyle destination. The 70-acre TRX is another catalyst for the area, he says. Located 2km from Chan Sow Lin, the mixed-use development will feature world-class residential, retail, leisure and cultural offerings. Upcoming components include the 17-acre Lifestyle Quarter \u2014 a retail-led mixed-use development by Australian property and infrastructure group Lendlease Corp (which has a 60% stake) and TRX City (40%) \u2014 and the Signature Tower by Indonesia\u2019s Mulia Group. Hong remarks that these two mega projects will bring in the most important catalyst \u2014 infrastructure. A network of infrastructure and public transport will be put in place to support the developments. There are plans to develop Bandar Malaysia into a transit-oriented development to provide seamless integration between the MRT, KTM Komuter, Express Rail Link and HSR lines. \u201cHSR will have its terminus at Bandar Malaysia while TRX will boast Kuala Lumpur\u2019s largest MRT station. The existing Chan Sow Lin LRT station will be integrated with the MRT Line 2 in the future, and it is located only one stop away from TRX. This is positive for Chan Sow Lin as with improved connectivity, more potential house buyers and investors may be attracted to developments in the area,\u201d says Hong. Besides its proximity to the Kuala Lumpur city centre and the availability of public transport, Chan Sow Lin is also easily accessible via various highways and roads, such as the Maju Expressway, Besraya Expressway, Jalan Sungai Besi and Jalan Loke Yew. Furthermore, it will be linked to the upcoming DUKE 3. As the 35km expressway will serve areas such as Wangsa Maju, Setiawangsa, Ampang and TRX, Hong says it will improve future accessibility and connectivity to the Chan Sow Lin area, providing alternative routes as well as reducing the travelling time and increasing the visibility of its surrounding areas. Hurdles The two main issues that landowners at Chan Sow Lin are facing are compulsory land acquisitions and the difficulty in extending their lease, says Ganesan. The association aims to assist them in dealing with these issues. Hong explains that the majority of parcels and properties in the locality have short leasehold tenure of about 60 years, and the extension of leases incurs additional development costs. \u201cAlso, there are additional costs to convert the existing land use from \u2018industry\u2019 to \u2018building\u2019, with express conditions for residential, commercial and mixed-use developments. The plot ratio of 1:2 and 1:6 as per the KL Structure Plan 2020 for land fronting Jalan Sungai Besi is also low.\u201d Another setback is that the parcels are generally small, measuring about one to two acres each, Hong says. It can be difficult to acquire a few adjoining lots to amalgamate for redevelopment as they are owned by different people, he points out. \u201cFurthermore, due to the area being an industrial zone, potential redevelopments there have to be on a piecemeal basis. There is no master-plan layout for the entire area and thus, upcoming residential and mixed-use projects may neighbour existing industrial premises, workshops or 3S and 4S centres.\u201d The narrow roads and their poor condition are also issues worth noting. Chua says the area\u2019s accessibility needs to be improved due to the potential increase in population following its redevelopment. Future prospects Moving forward, property experts believe the transformation of Chan Sow Lin will continue, with various types of developments to come up. They expect the area to grow as Bandar Malaysia progressively takes shape. Chua expects immediate projects there to be condominiums, serviced apartments and small office/home office (SoHo) units. \u201cFlatted factories or storage facilities are also a possibility in view of the current usage of the land and its proximity to the city centre,\u201d he says. Meanwhile, Hong says mixed-use developments \u2014 serviced apartments, SoHo, commercial and retail units as well as offices \u2014 will be suitable to cater for the local population and business community. \u201cFirst-time homebuyers and investors may be attracted to the locality as well due to the affordable housing choices at the city fringe, supported by excellent public transport links,\u201d he adds. \u201cMore developments are expected with the scheduled completion of MRT Line 2 in 2021/22 and the progress at Bandar Malaysia and TRX. New and modern developments will rejuvenate the area and raise the price point and quality of product offerings.\u201d"}, "80": {"date_posted": "10/7/2017", "title": "Half-year review of The Edge Financial Daily\u2019s Top 10 Stock Picks for 2017", "article": " The Edge Financial Daily compiled a list of 10 stock picks for the year based on some of the investment themes recommended by fund managers and analysts at the beginning of the year. While there were some recommendations that did well, the list overlooked certain sectors, such as the banking sector that has performed very well so far. However, \u201cThe Edge Financial Daily\u2019s Top 10 Stock Picks for Year 2017\u201d still managed to record an average total return of 18.6%. It outperformed the benchmark for most of the global markets except Korea\u2019s Kospi Index. \u00a0 Magni-Tech Industries Bhd\nThe top performer among the stock picks, Magni-Tech Industries Bhd, saw its share price surge by 82.23% in the first half of 2017 (1H17). Inter-Pacific Research, which gave a \u201cbuy\u201d call on the largest original manufacturer for Nike in Malaysia, has since upgraded the target price (TP) from RM5.72 at the beginning of the year to RM7.50 in the latest research report dated June 29. However, the research house has tweaked its view on the company to \u201cneutral\u201d. Brian Yeoh, the analyst who tracks the company, said in his report that he expects the garment maker to see its earnings in the financial year 2018 (FY18) and FY19 remain flat as its capacity utilisation is almost full. \u201cWe have turned cautious about earnings growth as its top customer, Nike, has been affected by a sluggish retail environment, slow US apparel industry sales and rising competitive pressure from Adidas and Under Armour,\u201d Yeoh said. The group\u2019s managing director, Tan Poay Seng, however, told The Edge Financial Daily that Magni-Tech still has capacity to grow from its current level with the construction of the first phase of its new factory in Vietnam expected in the first quarter next year. \u201cWe have started construction to build a modern and green flagship factory in Vietnam on a 44.2 sq m strategic land in Tien Giang Province,\u201d Tan said. According to him, the first phase would see an additional output of 10 million pieces of garments per year. The second phase is targeted to be completed by the first quarter of 2019, which will increase the output of another 10 million pieces per year. The question on whether Nike could maintain its earnings growth was posed at the beginning of 2017 but the sportswear giant\u2019s latest financial results topped analysts\u2019 expectations, helped by strong sales growth outside the US. It is also interesting to see how Nike\u2019s latest collaboration with Amazon and Instagram will pan out as Nike will soon start selling sneakers and other sporting goods through these platforms. While the latest tie-up could be a game changer and benefit Magni-Tech in the longer run, there has not been a lot of success by retail, luxury and beauty brands over selling to social media-addicted millennials. Nonetheless, Nike\u2019s decision to turn to Amazon and Instagram for the next phase of growth bodes well for investors as its share price jumped by 10.96% to US$59 (RM253.70) from US$53.17. As for Magni-Tech, despite a strong share-price performance, it is trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio (PER) of about 10 times. A long-term investor of the company would have seen an annual return of about 38.34% in the last 10 years. Another fund manager said that it is a tall order to maintain its earnings growth but the management has a strong track record and should be able to meet the expectations moving forward if Nike could penetrate into the millennials through Amazon and Instagram. It is also worth noting that the Fifa World Cup 2018, one of the most popular sporting events, could boost earnings growth for Nike, which could be beneficial to Magni-Tech as well. \u2014 By Billy Toh \u00a0 \u00a0 Bumi Armada Bhd\nDespite seeing a few contract cancellations, Bumi Armada Bhd recently saw its tides turn by achieving first oil for its Kraken floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) unit. The offshore oil and gas (O&G) services provider has seen a 15.15% return year to date, in terms of share price. The stock closed at 76 sen on June 30 up from 66 sen at the start of 2017. Choo Swee Kee of TA Investment Management continues to remain positive about the stock for the next six months in light of the establishment of a new FPSO in Ghana. \u201cOur hope is that all the bad news is out and moving forward earnings could start to pick up,\u201d he told The Edge Financial Daily. Net profit for the first financial quarter of FY17 (1QFY17) doubled to RM48.11 million on higher FPSO contribution although revenue slipped 6.17% to RM404.17 million due to lower utilisation of its offshore support vessel (OSV). However, the results marked a turnaround from a poor 4QFY16, with a net loss of RM1.29 billion due to impairment charges. According to Bloomberg data, 10 analysts have a \u201cbuy\u201d recommendation on the stock while eight recommend holding it. CIMB Research resumed coverage on the company, Asia\u2019s largest FPSO and OSV operator, in early June with an \u201cadd\u201d call, saying that with two terrible years now behind it, the group can look forward to improved earnings and cash flow. However, AmInvest Research, which has a \u201chold\u201d call on the stock, said that the cessation of FPSO operations in Nigeria warranted a cautious outlook for its near-term earnings trajectory. \u2014 By Samantha Ho \u00a0 \u00a0 Inari Amertron Bhd\nOne main catalyst for Inari Amertron Bhd being chosen as one of the top picks for the year was the anticipated positive impact from iPhone\u2019s 10th anniversary this year especially with the company having a solid relationship with Broadcom, which has a three-year supply agreement with Apple until 2018. The initial fear of how Trump\u2019s protectionism policy would affect Inari has also subsided, which is positive for the group as well. Affin Hwang Investment Bank Bhd\u2019s analyst, Kevin Low, said in his report dated June 29, that Inari should see a seasonal pickup in the radio frequency division to facilitate new builds for its US customer in 2H17. He said that Inari is upgrading tester capacity by 10% to 770 units. According to Low, production of the Iris chips has gradually ramped up to its installed capacity of five million units per month after being fully qualified in February this year and he expected the capacity to double in July with further plans of capacity expansion by the third quarter of this year, bringing installed capacity closer to the 16 million units per month level. The Iris chips are expected to contribute up to 14% of Inari\u2019s earnings by FY18. Besides near-term growth being fuelled by rising mobile device complexity, wider global LTE coverage and broader adoption of the Iris biometric scanning function, Inari also has a foot in the data server business and vertical cavity surface emitting laser packaging should also allow Inari to ride on the next wave of laser growth. In 1H17, the group\u2019s share price gained 29.63%. Affin Hwang maintains its \u201cbuy\u201d call for the company with a TP of RM2.60, which indicates an upside of 18.2% as of its closing price of RM2.20 last Friday. \u2014 By Billy Toh \u00a0 \u00a0 Sime Darby Bhd\nSime Darby Bhd\u2019s share price had been expected to climb on proposed corporate restructuring following the appointment of Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar as the chairman of Sime Darby\u2019s controlling shareholder, Permodalan Nasional Bhd. Half a year down the road, the conglomerate has offered more clarity on the restructuring plan, announcing an in specie dividend to existing shareholders for both its property and plantation units sometime in 4Q17. Its share price had gained 16% as at June 30. According to Bloomberg data, \u201cbuy\u201d calls on the stock continue to outweigh \u201chold\u201d calls by 11 to nine. Out of 23 analysts who cover the stock, the consensus TP of 19 of them is RM9.81 per share in Sime Darby. However, Moody\u2019s Investors Service has cautioned that it may downgrade the group\u2019s \u201cBaa1\u201d rating on uncertainties from the spin-offs as this would reduce diversification, scale and cash flow, thereby raising the group\u2019s business risks. \u2014 By Samantha Ho \u00a0 \u00a0 Genting Malaysia Bhd\nAlthough Genting Malaysia Bhd ended 1H17 as the second-best performer on the FBM KLCI with a 20.09% increase in share price, the party may not be over for the gaming counter just yet as more gaming and non-gaming revenue is expected to roll in throughout its upcoming quarters on full operations at its Sky Plaza. Maybank IB Research\u2019s Samuel Yin Shao Yang lifted earnings estimates by 3% to 6% for the next three years on higher priced meals at Sky Avenue, a higher average price per ticket at 20th Century Fox World and a maiden 20th Century Fox World sponsorship income of some RM50 million effective mid-2017. The research house upgraded its call from \u201chold\u201d to \u201cbuy\u201d and the counter\u2019s TP by 14% to RM6.15 from RM5.40, with earnings expected to grow in 3QFY17 supported by the opening of VIP rooms and 250 suites at the Sky Plaza, Genting Highlands Premium Outlet and the Theme Park Hotel. \u201cWe also understand that most Sky Avenue tenants will begin paying rent in 3QFY17 after their rent-free period expires,\u201d Yin noted. The 12-month consensus TP from 20 analysts is RM6.15, with seven having a \u201cbuy\u201d call and 11 analysts having a \u201chold\u201d call, while two are telling clients to sell the stock. \u2014 By Samantha Ho \u00a0 \u00a0 Ta Ann Holdings Bhd\nExpected to see a turnaround in 2017, Ta Ann Holdings Bhd was the worst performer in 1H17 among the 10 stock picks as its share price fell by 10.4%. Instead of bottom fishing, the experience of holding Ta Ann shares for investors would probably feel more like catching a falling knife instead. Nonetheless, analysts remain positive about the company, with Bloomberg compilation showing a 12-month TP of RM3.93, indicating an upside of 11.3%. However, of nine analysts, only two of them have a \u201cbuy\u201d call with the rest recommending to \u201chold\u201d. MIDF Research recommended a \u201cbuy\u201d call with a TP of RM4.30, which represents 21.8% upside to Ta Ann\u2019s 1QFY17 core net income of RM42.2 million, which was above expectations. Alan Lim, the analyst from MIDF Research, said that the strong result was caused by stellar performance of the plantation division as 1QFY17 fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production growth came in stronger than expected at 20% year-on-year to 148,715 tonnes. While the KL Plantation Index gained 3.9%, Ta Ann saw its share price fall by 10.4%. Recall that the group also saw a lacklustre year in 2016 when its share price fell by 5.58%. Lim said the recommendation being upgraded to \u201cbuy\u201d was due to an expectation of plantation division\u2019s earnings growth to remain strong on high FFB volume seen at 10%, the timber division to remain profitable due to support from high export log prices and it is a key laggard among plantation stocks. \u2014 By Billy Toh \u00a0 \u00a0 Protasco Bhd\nPicked as one of the construction players that were expected to benefit from the government\u2019s spending on infrastructure building, Protasco Bhd had not been up to the expectations, at least in terms of share price. The stock dropped nearly 8% in 1H17. Nonetheless, the company saw its joint venture with Kumpulan Perangsang Selangor Bhd awarded a RM174.4 million contract for the proposed infrastructure works at Pulau Indah Industrial Park, which are for 18 months and scheduled for completion in January 2019. Jeremy Goh, an analyst with Hong Leong Investment Bank (IB), shared that Protasco has a letter of intent for phase three of the 1Malaysia Housing Project for Civil Servants in Putrajaya. Other than a potential election play, Protasco also has a strong defensive nature for a construction player with its dividend yield of about 5.7%. Hong Leong IB has a TP of RM1.20 for Protasco, indicating an upside of 14.3% based on its close last Thursday. \u2014 By Billy Toh \u00a0 \u00a0 Sapura Energy Bhd\nO&G services provider Sapura Energy Bhd, previously SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd, saw its share price take a beating after reporting a 75% slump in its net profit for 1QFY18. A low oil price environment and worsening rig utilisation also did not help. Its share price had seen a drop in profitability amid higher taxation. Its revenue took a hit in 1QFY18, falling 9% on lower contributions from the drilling and exploration segment and the production segment. The results sent its share price down to RM1.57 \u2014 the lowest level since early December last year. It closed at RM1.65 last Friday, trading at a forward PER of slightly more than 40%, according to Bloomberg. Bloomberg data indicates that a higher number of analysts \u2014 now seven \u2014 has a \u201cbuy\u201d call on the stock compared with the five that recommended adding it at the beginning of the year. However, six analysts downgraded the stock within the past two months, lowering the consensus TP to RM3.19. \u2014 By Samantha Ho \u00a0 \u00a0 Classic Scenic Bhd\nWhile Classic Scenic Bhd underperformed against the FBM KLCI, the company has proven to be a resilient counter that is suitable for a defensive strategy with a high dividend yield of about 6.04%. The wooden picture frame maker\u2019s share price increased by 1.68% in 1H17. Its latest quarterly financial results showed a 12.2% decline in net profit to RM3.7 million for 1QFY17 from RM4.2 million in the corresponding quarter a year ago, mainly attributed to a varying product mix and higher cost of labour and operating expenses as a result of lower fair value gain from foreign currency forward contracts. The company is primarily involved in the manufacturing and export of high-end wooden picture framework mouldings and about 90% of its sales come from the export market, mainly to the US and are denominated in US dollars. Classic Scenic continues to remain one of the best defensive counters given the strong balance sheet, with its net cash standing at RM26.4 million or 21.9 sen per share at end-March, an increase from RM23.9 million in 2016. The group also has a good track record of generous dividend payout. In 2016, Classic Scenic paid a total of 11 sen per share for dividends, up from 10 sen per share a year ago. InsiderAsia, which remains positive about the company, estimated a total dividend of 13 sen to 14 sen per share for 2017, giving an above-market average yield of above 7%. \u2014\u00a0By Billy Toh \u00a0 \u00a0 Gamuda Bhd\nGamuda Bhd, whose shares soared 14.29% year-to-date to close at an eight-year high of RM5.50 per share, still appears to be riding on a wave of optimism towards the construction sector ahead of the upcoming elections. Widely held as a proxy for the sector and beneficiary of expected infrastructure jobs to be awarded, the counter still commands a \u201cbuy\u201d call by 18 out of 23 analysts covered by Bloomberg data. The consensus TP is RM5.93 per share by 20 out of 23 analysts. CIMB Research kept the counter as its top pick as a beneficiary of the rail theme, with Hong Leong Investment Bank agreeing that Gamuda would ride on upcoming mega rail projects such as the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High-Speed Rail, light rail transit Line 3 and East Coast Rail Link. Meanwhile, AffinHwang Capital Research had cut its earnings forecast by 5% to 6% to reflect lower property earnings and higher tax rates. However, it raised its TP for the stock to RM5.94 per share and highlighted that the group targeted a higher new contract target of RM10 billion from RM3 billion to RM4 billion this year. Property sales recovered for Gamuda in 3QFY17 at RM620 million compared with RM575 million in the year before. Net profit had been on a climb over the past three quarters to RM170.93 million in 3QFY17. The group also announced that it would be paying a second interim dividend of six sen per share on July 28. \u00a0\u2014\u00a0By Samantha Ho\n\u00a0"}, "81": {"date_posted": "30/6/2017", "title": "Sime Darby sells land to PNB for RM85.53m cash", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: Sime Darby Bhd is selling New Lunderston Estate, a freehold tract measuring 297.51 acres (120.4ha), in Selangor for RM85.53 million cash.

Sime Darby president and group chief executive officer (CEO) Tan Sri Mohd Bakke Salleh said there won\u2019t be many surprises when the announcement of the leadership for the three pure plays \u2014 Sime Darby Plantation Bhd, Sime Darby Property Bhd and Sime Darby Bhd \u2014 is made. \u201cThere will be familiar faces, and maybe one or two new ones as there are six important positions to be filled [for three pure plays], three CEO positions and three chief financial officer (CFO) positions. \u201cThis is being worked on at the moment, but I don\u2019t think you will be taken by surprise by the line-up,\u201d he told a media briefing yesterday in conjunction with the release of the group\u2019s results for the third financial quarter ended March 31, 2017 (3QFY17). Announcing the leadership of the pure play entities is one of the items on the group\u2019s checklist towards the listing of the entities by the end of the year. Also on that checklist is the restructuring of the group\u2019s remaining borrowings, prospectus submissions, obtaining approval from the relevant authorities, external engagements and the convening of an extraordinary general meeting to obtain its shareholders\u2019 approval. The group completed the restructuring of its US$800 million (RM3.42 billion) sukuk last Tuesday, which was a major milestone in the group\u2019s debt reorganisation to create the three pure plays. The sukuk comprises two series: US$400 million that matures in 2018 (Series 18) and the remainder US$400 million that will mature in 2023 (Series 23). Sime Darby group CFO Datuk Tong Poh Keow said about 21.5% of the sukuk holders had agreed to novate their bonds to Sime Darby Plantation. \u201cWe gave them (the sukuk holders) the option to either tender out or to novate depending on their preference, so the remaining [78.5%] opted to cash out. \u201cBut you have to remember that about US$400 million of this sukuk actually [matures] in 2018, and that is largely where we saw the tender coming out, from this group,\u201d she said. The group paid US$353.8 million to its Series 18 sukuk holders and US$277.5 million to its Series 23 sukuk holders. The restructuring of the rest of the group\u2019s borrowings is currently ongoing. As for its financials, Sime Darby reported a 5% year-on-year (y-o-y) net profit rise in its 3QFY17 to RM699 million from RM663 million, on improved contributions from its plantation, industrial and motor divisions. Revenue grew 22% y-o-y to RM12.44 billion from RM10.23 billion. For the cumulative nine months ended March 31, 2017, the group reported a 40% y-o-y jump in net profit to RM1.79 billion from RM1.27 billion, while revenue grew 8% to RM34.88 billion from RM32.23 billion. Bakke highlighted that the group had so far achieved 81% of its target net profit for the financial year ending June 30, 2017 (FY17) of RM2.2 billion. \u201cWe are working very hard to achieve our [target profit], but there are challenges we need to grapple with. For example, in Indonesia, the port authorities have announced a 10-day holiday in conjunction with Hari Raya festivities \u2014 that will be a challenge as it is a critical period for us to move our products,\u201d said Bakke. The performance of the group\u2019s plantation division in the quarter was enhanced by average crude palm oil (CPO) selling price realised, which was 40% higher at RM3,088 per tonne in 3QFY17 compared with RM2,200 in 3QFY16. \u201cWe think CPO prices will stay above RM2,500 per tonne, at least for the next six months,\u201d said Bakke. Sime Darby\u2019s plantation division managing director Datuk Franki Anthony Dass also shared that the group expects palm oil production to be 3% to 4% higher in FY17 compared with FY16.

As a result, foreign institutional and retail investors\u2019 exposure as a percentage to total value of Malaysian shares traded fell to 19% last month from 20.75% in March 2017. Data from Bursa Malaysia released last week showed that foreign trading volume also declined 25% to 3.9 billion shares last month from 5.2 billion shares in March 2017. Nevertheless, foreign purchases of Malaysian stocks were still above the levels recorded in January and February this year of RM9 billion and RM7.8 billion respectively. Foreign trading activity for Malaysian stocks has also been rising from three billion shares and 3.4 billion shares in January and February 2017 respectively. According to market analysts, foreign institutional and retail investors\u2019 flow will continue to remain robust in the near term as Malaysian market performance still lags behind its regional peers. \u201cInvestors globally are on a \u2018risk-on\u2019 position where their risk appetite is relatively higher, with a focus on emerging underperformed markets like Malaysia which has lagged behind its peers in the past three years,\u201d Areca Capital Sdn Bhd chief executive officer Danny Wong Teck Meng told The Edge Financial Daily. Year to date, the benchmark FBM KLCI has risen 7.8% to close at 1,762.74 points last Friday. This compares with Thailand SET Index\u2019s gain of 0.35%, 7.7% increase by Jakarta Stock Exchange Composite Index, and 11.41% rise by Singapore\u2019s Straits Times Index. Wong sees the Malaysian market playing \u201ccatch up in a bottom-up economy\u201d, adding that a small stock market correction is likely this month. \u201cIt is too early to judge whether there is a \u2018bubble\u2019 in the making. I guess the bubble would have some more room to grow, just waiting for a potential small correction in May,\u201d he said, referring to the local stock market\u2019s strong run. Philip Capital Management Sdn Bhd chief investment officer Ang Kok Heng said he would not be surprised if a small market correction happens, noting the well-known trading adage \u201cSell in May and Go Away\u201d. Nonetheless, Ang believes there\u2019s still room for more foreign buying on Bursa. \u201cOther regional markets have been seeing foreign inflows much earlier than Malaysia; we are just catching up. Yes, we expect there is some more room for more foreign buying of Malaysian equities. The entire mood has changed [for foreign investors] since the US dollar stopped strengthening against major currencies like last year,\u201d he added. Inter-Pacific Research Sdn Bhd head of research Pong Teng Siew concurred, saying that the higher money supply and credit flow in Malaysia implied more business activities in the pipeline. According to Bank Negara Malaysia\u2019s data, March broad money supply, M3, grew 4.5% to RM1.67 trillion, from RM1.60 trillion in the same month last year, while total loan in the banking system grew 5.96% to RM1.54 trillion, from RM1.45 trillion in March 2016. \u201cThere are reasons to be optimistic in Malaysia ... the money supply implies great deal of liquidity in the market. There is also better credit flowing, but it is also because foreign investment banks are positioning themselves for a piece of advisory business opportunity here,\u201d Pong said. He noted that one of the notable corporate exercises that most investment bankers are eyeing is the proposed demerger of Sime Darby Bhd\u2019s businesses. In February this year, the diversified group proposed to float its property and plantation divisions separately on Bursa through distribution of shares to its shareholders. With the completion of the exercise, there will be three separate and independent listed entities with distinct businesses, with Sime Darby Plantation and Sime Darby Property to undertake the current plantation and property businesses of Sime Darby. Sime Darby itself would remain listed with the trading business comprising motor and industrial, logistics business, and other businesses including healthcare, insurance, retail and investments."}, "86": {"date_posted": "1/5/2017", "title": "Promoting Malaysian stocks to Japanese investors", "article": " WHEN conglomerate Sime \u00adDarby Bhd, rubber glove \u00admanufacturer Top Glove Corp Bhd and \u00adcondom maker Karex Bhd were featured at an investment seminar organised by Bursa Malaysia in Japan last year, one Japanese was particularly impressed with the size and quality of these listed firms. Yoshitaka Harada, managing director of Musashi Securities Co Ltd, admits that before he attended the seminar, he did not know that Karex is the largest condom manufacturer in the world, while Top Glove is the world\u2019s biggest rubber gloves producer. \u201cLast July, Bursa Malaysia brought Sime Darby, Karex and Top Glove for an Investor Relations (IR) presentation to Japanese retail investors. It is pretty rare for Malaysian companies to do IR in Japan,\u201d he tells The Edge. Musashi Securities is a mid-cap securities firm in Saitama City, near Tokyo. According to Harada, Malaysian listed companies have not gone to the Japanese market in a big way, but the pioneer three companies promoted by Bursa have piqued the interest of investors there. \u201cAfter that seminar, our retail investors came to us and said they want to buy into these Malaysian companies. But the problem is, we didn\u2019t have any broker in Malaysia,\u201d he says. Musashi Securities then reached out to a few local brokerage firms for potential partnership, before deciding that Mercury Securities Sdn Bhd is a good fit. \u201cMercury Securities, being our local partner, will provide us a lot of information and research material about Malaysian companies. With that, we hope to promote more Malaysian stocks to our Japanese retail investors,\u201d Harada says. Last month, Musashi Securities, Japanese Securities Journal Research and Mercury Securities organised an investment seminar in Kuala Lumpur. Four Japanese listed companies \u2014 S-Pool Inc, Avant Corp, Intelligence Wave Inc and Yumeshin Holdings Co Ltd \u2014 with a market capitalisation of \u00a54.2 billion (RM170 million), \u00a59.1 billion, \u00ad\u00a513.9 billion and \u00a560.6 billion respectively, were featured at the seminar, which saw the attendance of prominent fund managers, including Phua Lee Kerk of Phillip Mutual\u2019s and Choo Swee Kee of TA Investment Management. Yumeshin and S-Pool are manpower service providers, while Avant and Intelligence Wave are application software companies. Musashi Securities launched a \u00adshariah-related fund three years ago, the first of its kind in Japan. With assets under management of about US$30 million (RM132 million), Harada says most of it has been invested in Malaysia, because this is the market where it can find the most shariah-compliant stocks. \u201cI came to Malaysia for the first time about 10 years ago. But in the last couple of years, I came here very often. I think the Malaysian economy has been growing steadily, unlike China, whose growth is the envy of many countries, but is facing challenges to sustain its remarkable growth story,\u201d he says. He believes that as the Asean economy grows, supported by an increase in population and the middle class, the Malaysian stock \u00admarket will draw foreign investors\u2019 attention as a good number of shariah-compliant companies are listed here. \u201cThere are two things we like about the Malaysian stock market. The growth potential of the hybrid Islamic economy and Chinese economy as well as the strong leadership of Asean countries. Your economy is a mixture of Chinese and Islamic economies. It is diversified, which is very attractive to Japanese investors like us,\u201d he says. Harada points out that the weakness of the ringgit is good for export-oriented companies, and he believes most of them are making good profits now. \u201cOver the years, we like the growth story of Malaysia and we still believe in that story,\u201d he says. Moving forward, Harada says, Musashi \u00adSecurities will focus on promoting \u00adcompanies with growth potential in the near term, \u00adreasonable dividend yield and excellent governance records. \u201cJapanese investors focus not only on the price-earnings ratio but also the potential to grow. We will recommend high growth stocks,\u201d he says. He adds that although Japanese retail \u00adinvestors have already invested in Malaysian stocks via mutual funds, they do not actually have an opportunity to directly invest in the individual companies because there is a lack of information. Therefore, Musashi Securities now aims to educate Japanese investors, be it high-net-worth individuals or retail investors, via seminars or face-to-face sales promotion with the help of Mercury Securities. Harada believes that in the near future, Japanese companies will accelerate their investments and mergers and acquisitions \u00adactivities in Malaysia, and Musashi \u00adSecurities hopes to participate as an active business \u00adpartner. \u201cFor Japanese multinational \u00adcompanies planning plan to expand their business in \u00adMalaysia, we will provide them with opportunities such as M&A and business partners.\u201d Yoshitaka says some Japanese firms have been trying to expand their businesses into this region, but they have to invest in certain local companies to achieve it. For instance, Tokyo-based Nippon \u00adYusen \u00adKabushiki Kaisha (NYK Line), one of the \u00adoldest and largest shipping companies in the world, controls 65% of Malaysian logistics firm \u00adTASCO Bhd. \u201cWe believe such inbound investment \u00adactivities by Japanese companies will keep on going in the coming years,\u201d he says. Malaysian companies are also looking for business partners in Japan, and Musashi \u00adSecurities wants to play a significant role in identifying and eventually matching the \u00adparties,\u00a0 with each achieving its respective investment objectives. \u201cJapanese companies are very strong in technology, which could be something Malaysian companies are looking for. At the same time, when Japanese companies expand their presence into this part of the world, they will need to have local knowledge and skills, which Malaysian companies can provide,\u201d Harada\u00a0 says. \u00a0"}, "87": {"date_posted": "19/4/2017", "title": "Sime Darby invites cash repurchase or novation of up to US$800m sukuk", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: Sime Darby Bhd yesterday announced its invitation to eligible holders of two tranches of its outstanding sukuk amounting to US$800 million (RM3.53 billion) to either tender for cash repurchase or novate the debt to Sime Darby Plantation Sdn Bhd. In a filing with the stock exchange, Sime Darby said the cash repurchase involves a multi-currency US$1.5 billion sukuk programme issued by Sime Darby Global Bhd on Jan 29, 2013, of which the outstanding sukuk is in two tranches of US$400 million each. One tranche expires in 2018 and the other in 2023. Under the cash repurchase option, Sime Darby said it will pay 98% of the face amount of the 2018 due sukuk, and 97% of the sukuk due in 2023. The cash repurchase tender offer began yesterday and will close by May 11 this year. Under the second option, Sime Darby is seeking consent for Sime Darby Plantation to be the new obligor in place of Sime Darby in its capacities as obligor, seller and lessee. It is also seeking consent to amend certain \u201cconsequential changes\u201d to the terms and conditions of the programme, including waiving the occurrence of a dissolution event as a result of the reorganisation. Sime Darby said the tender offers are made in connection with the proposed reorganisation of its businesses, which the group announced on Feb 27. The reorganisation will see a restructuring of the group, which will result in the creation of three independent pure play companies to be listed on Bursa Malaysia, namely Sime Darby Plantation, Sime Darby Property and Sime Darby. Meanwhile, Fitch Ratings said yesterday it expected to assign Sime Darby Plantation a long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating of \u201cBBB+(EXP)\u201d with stable outlook, and an expected senior unsecured rating of \u201cBBB+(EXP)\u201d. \u201cWe have assumed that Sime Darby Plantation, which had about RM8.3 billion of inter-company loans from Sime Darby and other group companies as at June 2016, will receive US$600 million of debt (including outstanding issuance under a US$1.5 billion sukuk programme) and RM2.2 billion of perpetual subordinated sukuk (issued under a RM3 billion programme) from Sime Darby,\u201d it said. \u201cSime Darby Plantation\u2019s scale and diversification reduce risks from weather-related events in specific regions and changes in regulatory regimes, and give the company better funding access. Its downstream manufacturing footprint also gives the company easier access to key palm product markets in Asia and Europe,\u201d it said. Fitch said it estimated that the total debt to be transferred to Sime Darby Plantation would total to RM4.9 billion by June 2017, after the transfer is completed. Yesterday, Moody\u2019s Investors Service also assigned a first-time Baa1 issuer rating to Sime Darby Plantation, adding that the rating outlook was stable and reflected its expectation that Sime Darby Plantation\u2019s management would maintain a prudent and conservative approach towards any further investments. \u201cSime Darby Plantation\u2019s Baa1 issuer rating reflects its market leadership position, firstly, as the largest listed oil palm plantation company by planted area and crude palm oil production, and secondly, as the leading producer globally of certified sustainable palm oil,\u201d said Moody\u2019s vice-president and senior analyst Jacintha Poh. Poh added, however, that the rating was constrained by Sime Darby Plantation\u2019s exposure to volatile crude palm oil prices."}, "88": {"date_posted": "13/4/2017", "title": "Off-Market Trades: Sime Darby Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd, Genting Malaysia Bhd, XingHe Holdings Bhd, ManagePay Systems Bhd", "article": " BETWEEN March 22 and 28,\u00a0 a total of 1.03 billion shares worth RM1.72 billion changed hands off market in blocks of at least 400,000 shares. Notable transactions included that at Sime Darby Bhd, where 34.39 million shares worth RM322.14 million were traded at RM9.35 to RM9.52 apiece. Sime Darby\u2019s share price has been on an upward trend, closing at a multi-year high of RM9.50 on March 23. According to filings with Bursa Malaysia, the bulk of the activity at Sime Darby could be transactions by institutional funds, including the Employees Provident Fund, Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) and Amanah\u00adRaya Trustees Bhd\u2013Amanah Saham Bumiputera (ATB-ASB). This includes a direct deal of 27.89 million shares worth RM260.78 million in a single transaction at RM9.35 apiece on March 27, which was within the day\u2019s trading range of RM9.33 to RM9.45.

According to filings, ATB\u2013ASB disposed of the stake to an undisclosed party. Genting Malaysia Bhd was another large-cap counter that saw vibrant trading over the period under review. A total of 36.5 million shares worth RM202.96 million were transacted at RM5.46 to RM5.71 apiece over the period. As at press time, it was not clear who were involved in the trades. The period under review also saw a significant number of transactions involving China stocks and technology counters. This was likely driven by the launch of the Digital Free Trade Zone on March 22, which will see the Alibaba Group use Malaysia as its regional logistics hub. The DFTZ will also involve the development of an e-services platform to help local small and medium enterprises leverage e-commerce to boost cross-border trade with China\u2019s Hangzhou region. Among the handful of Bursa-listed China companies, noteworthy off-market trades included that at China Automobile Parts Holdings Ltd, where 16.68 million shares worth RM505,000 were traded at 2.5 sen to 3.5 sen apiece. China Automobile Parts has been trading at 2 sen to 3.5 sen per share since last July. XingHe Holdings Bhd, meanwhile, saw 8.51 million shares worth RM335,000 done at 3.5 sen to 4 sen apiece.

The benchmark FBM KLCI is up 5.99%, its fastest quarterly expansion since 2013 and its best start to a year since 2007. The return of foreign investors, who were net sellers over the past two years due to a weakened ringgit, is one of the factors that is fuelling the rally. Year to date till March 24, foreign investors have poured a net RM1.378 billion into local stocks, according to data tracked by MIDF Research. The past two years had seen a net outflow of RM19.5 billion in 2015 and RM3 billion last year. However, the FBM KLCI is still lagging behind other emerging markets, slightly underperforming the MSCI Developed Markets Index, which rose 6.21% in 1Q2017. In comparison, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index has expanded twice as fast at 12.43% over the same period. This lag is consistent with the trend over the past 12 months, says AllianceDBS Research head of research Bernard Ching. While improving fundamentals and sustained bullish sentiment will keep the Malaysian market buoyant in the near term, he says the upside to fundamental valuations has narrowed, though not yet stretched. \u201cAsset prices are likely to overshoot fundamental values in a liquidity driven rally,\u201d Ching says. \u201cAs such, investors should look for profit-taking opportunities as and when they arise.\u201d The emerging question is whether the strong first quarter is signalling a strong year ahead for the FBM KLCI. It began the past two years in green, albeit more moderate, territory but finished in the red, down 3% last year and falling 3.9% in 2015. Thus far, Bursa Malaysia has closed three consecutive years in retreat, although it is still, according to Bloomberg, technically, the world\u2019s longest bull market at eight years and counting since the last correction over 20% in 2008. Some indicators, such as the ringgit, are looking up, but have proved to be false hope before. The ringgit has regained some lost ground against the greenback over the past three months, up 1.35% to 4.4255 as at March 31. However, it is still down 12% over the past year compared with 3.8905 on April 1 last year. In US dollar terms, the FBM KLCI has gained 8.1% YTD, outperforming some regional peers such as the Jakarta Composite Index (+6.8%) and the Nikkei (+4.8%), though lagging behind the Straits Times Index (+14.2%) and the Hang Seng Index (+10.2%). Banks and government-linked companies have driven the FBM KLCI\u2019s rise this quarter, making up 7 of the top 10 gainers among its 30 constituents. Corporate announcements and news flow are a significant sentiment driver this quarter. A notable example is Sime Darby Bhd\u2019s 14.57% rise up to March 31 as excitement builds over its much-anticipated demerger plan that will see the plantation and property units separately listed on Bursa. The demerger plan was announced in February, six months after Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar took the helm at Permodalan Nasional Bhd, the bumiputera equity firm that controls the majority of Sime Darby shares. With a reputation in corporate Malaysia as a \u201cMr Fixit\u201d, Wahid\u2019s mandate is to improve the corporate performance of PNB\u2019s stable of companies. When he took over, the cumulative performance of PNB companies underperformed the FBM KLCI. The impact on investor sentiment was almost immediate \u2014 the collective showing of PNB companies overtook the benchmark in October and has outperformed the FBM KLCI year to date. Elsewhere across the market this quarter, the shift in sentiment and investing appetite is also clearly visible as investors opt for commodity and cyclical stocks over more defensive counters. While the inflection point came around October last year, the shift has been more pronounced so far this year. YTD, commodity counters are collectively up 10.5% while cyclicals are up 10.8%. In comparison, defensive counters are up by a total of 1.7%. Among the commodity counters that have done well are Press Metal Bhd which chalked up a YTD return of 66.1%, Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd (34.2%) and Batu Kawan Bhd (23.1%). The outperformers among the cyclicals were AirAsia Bhd (62.6%), Ekovest Bhd (48.1%) and Malaysia Building Society Bhd (44.4%). The defensive stocks that outperformed included My E.G. Services Bhd (25.2%), TIME dotCom Bhd (11.9%) and Axiata Bhd (9.1%). Ching of AllianceDBS Research expects this trend to continue as cyclical stocks tend to outperform defensive stocks in a liquidity-driven rally. \u201cEarnings prospects for Malaysian equities have improved after the earnings downgrade cycle ended in 3Q2016. With a nascent earnings recovery and more stable commodity prices, cyclical stocks will outperform defensive stocks in 2017,\u201d Ching says. Outside of the 30 top stocks making up the benchmark index, small and mid-cap companies are also taking off and outperformed the FBM KLCI. The FBM70 Index has risen 12% since the year began, while the FBM Small Cap Index grew 15.5%. Much of the bullishness has been seen in the technology counters, which is the best performing sector YTD with a 38.2% gain. Construction and property counters are also rallying by just over 15% each. Driving the tech sector\u2019s rally is excitement over Apple Inc\u2019s upcoming iPhone 8, with most expecting strong sales. Players within the Apple supply chain such as Globetronics Technology Bhd and Inari Amertron Bhd were among the first counters to surge. While Ching sees further upside for tech stocks, he says valuations are now quite fair after the YTD run-up and thinks a rerating will only happen once the iPhone 8 begins selling around the third quarter of the year. Meanwhile, the property rally is driven by investors seeing the sector as a good proxy to the larger market, says Kenanga Research head of equity research Sarah Lim. However, the rally is detached from physical market fundamentals and is more driven by news flow. Lim believes valuations have bottomed out and developers are unlikely to see substantial earnings misses this year. \u201cMore likely, we will see most developers on target or slightly beating estimates for the full year in terms of sales.\u201d Notably, the oil and gas sector rose 8.2% this quarter as global Brent crude oil prices remained steady around US$55 per barrel for most of the quarter, thanks to the six-month, Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries-led output cut which began in January. However, the outlook for oil and gas stocks remains uncertain, says Ching, and will largely depend on company-specific news flow and further movement in oil prices. \u201cWhile kitchen sinking and impairment charges are largely done, earnings recovery is still at a nascent stage and uneven, given the low utilisation rate (for vessel owners) and slow order book replenishment (for fabricators),\u201d says Ching. As at March 30, Brent crude was trading at US$52.96 a barrel, down 7.8% from its YTD high of US$57.10 on Jan 6. \u00a0 \u00a0"}, "90": {"date_posted": "10/4/2017", "title": "Mazda sees Malaysia as springboard to Asean", "article": " \u00a0 KUALA LUMPUR: Mazda Malaysia Sdn Bhd, a 30%-owned associate of Bermaz Auto Bhd, is eyeing a larger slice of the pie in the Asean markets, as the automotive firm targets to export the locally assembled CX-5 to Cambodia, Indonesia and Myanmar in the second half of this year. \u201cMazda Japan is very bullish on Asean, and they want to support us (Mazda Malaysia) to make Malaysia an exporting hub,\u201d said Bermaz Auto executive director Datuk Francis Lee Kok Chuan when met in Singapore late last month. Mazda Malaysia, the local assembler of Mazda vehicles in Malaysia, is a 30:70 joint venture between Bermaz Auto and Japanese car giant Mazda Motor Corp (Mazda Japan). \u201cAnd next year, Mazda Malaysia hopes to export to one of the countries in the Middle East. We are working with the Malaysian government and are hoping to form some FTAs (free trade agreements) at the G2G (government-to-government) level. Otherwise, it will not be feasible with all the duties involved,\u201d he said. Currently, Lee said 50% of Mazda Malaysia\u2019s sales come from the export market. He expects the portion to expand in future. More recently, back in Kuala Lumpur, he told The Edge Financial Daily that Mazda Malaysia had invested over US$20 million in a new paint shop at Inokom Corp Sdn Bhd\u2019s plant in Kulim, Kedah, last year, so that they can produce the latest Mazda vehicle colours, \u201cand more importantly, to cater for the Asean export markets\u201d. However, he declined to reveal any export target numbers. Besides Mazda vehicles, Bermaz Auto also distributes the brand\u2019s spare parts in Malaysia and the Philippines. The group has a 29% stake in Inokom, the contract manufacturer of various marques, including Mazda vehicles. Other shareholders of the consortium are Sime Darby Motors Sdn Bhd (51%), Hyundai Motor Co of South Korea (15%) and Sime Darby Hyundai Sdn Bhd (5%). Lee said after the new paint shop is installed, production capacity at the Inokom plant will be increased from 18,000 units to 35,000 units over two shifts. This, he said, should augur well for both Mazda Malaysia and Inokom Corp, which ultimately also benefits Bermaz Auto. \u201cWith this increase in volume, Mazda Malaysia will try to export as many Mazda vehicles as possible, by making Malaysia the Asean exporting hub,\u201d said Lee. He also said the export sales figures will not be reflected in Bermaz Auto\u2019s total vehicle sales, as Mazda Malaysia will be the one that exports Mazda vehicles to other Asean markets through its own distributors in their respective countries. \u201cThe exports have nothing [directly] to do with us (Bermaz Auto). Mazda Malaysia will export [the cars] to their own national sales office in Thailand, as well as their distributors in Indonesia, Cambodia and Myanmar. These are the major export markets that they are looking at,\u201d Lee clarified. \u201cOf course, there will be earnings contributions to Bermaz Auto, because we also own [a] 30% stake in Mazda Malaysia,\u201d he said. Vietnam is not included in Mazda Malaysia\u2019s export plan as Mazda Japan operates a manufacturing plant there, said Lee. The Japanese automaker also owns a plant in Thailand. Bermaz Auto\u2019s car sales are mainly driven by the Mazda 2 completely built-up (CBU) model imported from Thailand, as well as the Mazda 3 and CX-5, which are completely knocked-down (CKD) models assembled at Inokom\u2019s plant in Kulim. Currently, the group has over 10 CBU models in its portfolio, but only two CKD models \u2014 namely Mazda 3 and CX-5. Bermaz Auto changed its name from Berjaya Auto after a management buyout last year, as it is no longer a major subsidiary of Berjaya Corp Bhd. Bermaz Auto has been recording lower car sales of late, in line with declining industry-wide volumes since the beginning of last year. The company, however, is unfazed by the situation. On the sidelines of Maybank Investment Bank\u2019s Invest Asean 2017 forum in Singapore, Lee said the group\u2019s strategy is to promote higher margin products, such as vehicles with typically higher selling prices. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to push [lower-value cars], because the more [of those] cars we push, the more money we lose. So we only push those from which we can make money,\u201d he said. For the two months ended Feb 28 this year, sales of Mazda brand vehicles in Malaysia fell 41% to 1,264 units from 2,136 units a year ago. Over the entire 2016, Mazda brand vehicles sales shrank 13% to 12,493 units from 14,325 units in 2015. Bermaz Auto recorded a 39% fall in net profit in its third quarter ended Jan 31, 2017 to RM25.11 million from RM41.13 million in the same quarter a year ago. The earnings figure was the lowest Bermaz Auto charted since the company\u2019s public listing back in 2013. Revenue was down 35% at RM338.68 million, versus RM522.58 million previously. Despite the weaker financial performance, Lee thinks Bermaz Auto is still outperforming some industry peers. \u201cWe are still reporting profit, unlike other players. Most of them are losing money because of the high depreciation of the ringgit,\u201d he said. Lee also believes that Bermaz Auto\u2019s prospects will improve in FY18, driven mainly by the introduction of Mazda\u2019s new CX-5 and CX-9 models in Malaysia by June this year. The supply of these models is already short globally, he noted. \u201cThese are high margin products, especially the CX-9. Mazda Japan has given us some units to sell in Malaysia,\u201d he said, adding that Bermaz has an average gross profit margin of up to 15%. Currently, Lee said all 16 units of the CX-9 supplied by Mazda Japan for sale in Malaysia have already been taken up by local buyers, prior to the June launch. \u201cSo people are still buying big-ticket items. For those people at that kind of level of income, there is no such thing as reducing their expenditure. If it is the mass market, yes, I agree [consumer spending is lowering]. Because [some of] these people live hand-to-mouth every day [so] they can\u2019t even consider buying a car. But the middle- to high-income earners, as long as they have steady jobs, they got nothing to worry about,\u201d he also said. Lee also said Bermaz Auto is not going to provide any discounts for its products, regardless of the lower sales volume it has been seeing. \u201cIn fact, the new CX-5 is going to be few thousand ringgit more expensive, because it is new. We don\u2019t want to give discounts like the others, because it will affect the resale value of existing customers\u2019 cars. We need to keep our customers happy, even post sale. Because at the end of the day, a happy customer will be the best product ambassador,\u201d he added. On the public listing of Bermaz Auto\u2019s 60.4%-owned Philippines Mazda vehicle distributor, BermazAuto Philippines Inc (BAP), Lee said management remains confident about completing the exercise by the first half of 2017. He estimated that out of the RM82.49 million proceeds to be raised through BAP\u2019s initial public offering, up to RM22 million would be repatriated to BAP\u2019s Malaysian shareholders. \u201cWe have to pay some fees after repatriating the money. So, hopefully, we can pay some dividends after deducting everything,\u201d he said. For the nine-months ended Jan 31, 2017, Bermaz Auto declared a dividend payout of 8.5 sen per share, versus 6.9 sen in the previous corresponding period, although earnings per share fell to 8.45 sen from 12.84 sen. A quick check on Bloomberg showed that seven research analysts who track Bermaz Auto have a \u201cbuy\u201d call on it, while another five have given it a \u201chold\u201d recommendation. With a consensus target price of RM2.21, they reckon the counter still has a 9.4% upside potential, from its closing of RM2.02 last Friday.

As such HLIB Research maintains its \"buy\" recommendation on Sime Darby with a target price of RM10.06. This is underpinned by various factors, including its plan to spin off the plantation and property businesses, which would further crystalise Sime Darby's deep intrinsic value; recent completion of private placement, which has strengthened Sime Darby's balance sheet; and anticipation of better quarters ahead on the back of better plantation and property earnings. RHB Research has also maintained \"buy\" rating on the stock with a target price of RM10.15, in view that Sime Darby's restructuring and demerger plans would be value enhancing, particularly to its plantations and property spin-offs. \u00a0"}, "93": {"date_posted": "23/3/2017", "title": "Off-Market Trades: Jaya Tiasa Holdings Bhd, SCH Group, Lay Hong Bhd, Sime Darby Bhd", "article": " This article first appeared in Capital, The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on March 13 - 19, 2017. BETWEEN March 1 and 7, a total of 752.8 million shares worth RM836.8 million were transacted off market in blocks of at least 400,000 shares. Sarawak-based timber producer Jaya Tiasa Holdings Bhd saw 21 million shares or a 2.17% stake change hands in a direct deal on March 6 at RM1.06 apiece, a 12.4% discount to the RM1.21 the stock fetched on the open market that day. The buyer was Tiong Toh Siong Enterprise Sdn Bhd \u2014 one of several vehicles linked to Sibu-based timber tycoon Tan Sri Tiong Hiew King of Rimbunan Hijau Group \u2014 which saw its direct holding rise to 5.21%, above the 5% substantial shareholding threshold, a March 8 filing with Bursa Malaysia shows. Tiong\u2019s overall holding rose to 29.01% after the transaction, of which only 0.92% is held directly. From RM1.42 per share on Feb 16, Jaya Tiasa\u2019s share price had fallen as much as 14% to a seven-month low of RM1.22 on Feb 27 and March 1 and 6. Last Wednesday, the counter surged 3.2% to close at RM1.27. At SCH Group, which sells quarry-based products and machinery, co-founders Wong Sin Chin and Yeen Yoon Hin pared down their holdings and were no longer the company\u2019s substantial shareholders as at March 2. They were likely the sellers of the 43.16 million shares or a 10.47% stake done via two direct deals on March 2 at 19 sen apiece, an 11.8% premium to the 17 sen per share the stock fetched on the open market that day. Wong sold 22.63 million shares while the rest were from Yeen. The transactions left Wong with a direct stake of 4.95% and Yeen with 4.21%. The block was bought by Liew Fook Meng and Chow Dai Ying via Thianjing Holdings Sdn Bhd. Prior to the purchase, Chow had a small direct stake of 0.44% in SCH as at Nov 29 last year. It is worth noting that SCH shares have gained 29.4% since the beginning of this month. The stock closed at 22 sen last Wednesday. In end-November, the stock had plunged from 23 sen to 18 sen over three days and gone on to touch a multiple-year low of 16 sen on Dec 23.

The 90.5 sen price for 23.06 million shares transacted on March 2 was at a 0.55% discount to the 91 sen the stock fetched on the open market that day. The transaction price for the remaining 2.4 million shares on March 1, however, was 2.8% above the 88 sen they fetched on the open market then. Lay Hong\u2019s largest shareholder is the founding Yap family with a 36% stake. Japanese meat-packing company NH Foods Ltd had a 21.8% stake as at Oct 21 last year. Recall that Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed NH Foods surfaced in Lay Hong in January last year, following a share placement exercise of a 10% stake worth RM30.52 million. The exercise preceded a joint venture to manufacture and sell processed meat-based products in Malaysia. Since the share placement exercise, Lay Hong\u2019s share price has risen by a third.

He said that from an investment management perspective, conglomerates are not a top pick due to their complexity when it comes to valuations. \u201cI am not a fan of conglomerates, because they are difficult to value and [hence] difficult to invest in. We would far rather invest in a pure play. \u201c[For example,] if we think crude palm oil prices are going to go up and we want to invest in a plantation company, it would be difficult for us to invest in Sime Darby [the conglomerate] as opposed to let\u2019s say, United Plantations Bhd. \u201cTherefore, we think it was a very sensible move by Sime Darby to split itself into three pure plays,\u201d he said at a news conference in conjunction with the Alice Smith-Chamber Brunch yesterday. The conglomerate model, on a global scale, is also not as common as before, said Gilbert. \u201cI would say that globally we are not seeing the presence of the big conglomerates as before, and [instead] we are seeing a big split in conglomerates globally, such as with General Electric [Co] in the US. \u201cWhen people analyse conglomerates, they do the sum of the parts and say if you split it up, then it will be worth more than the [current] listing. I think Sime Darby has been very smart to do that,\u201d he said. Sime Darby announced on Feb 27 it would be spinning off its plantation and property businesses, by listing the two units separately as Sime Darby Plantation Bhd and Sime Darby Property Bhd on Bursa Malaysia, via share distribution to existing shareholders. The exercise is expected to take place early next year. The group\u2019s industrial, motors, logistics and other businesses will continue to be housed under Sime Darby. Aberdeen Asset Management is a global asset manager with presence in 26 countries. As at Sep 30, 2016, the group\u2019s total assets under management in Asia stood at US$79.1 billion. \u201cWe have about US$3 billion (RM13.32 billion) from external money invested in Malaysia.

He told TheEdgeProperty.com after his presentation at the 10th Malaysian Property Summit 2017 that landed residential property prices are on the downtrend. \u201cLanded property prices in new prime areas, such as Nusajaya, have been declining in the past two years at an average pace of 15% to 20%. I don\u2019t think the dust has settled yet but many things could happen. However, considering the downtrend, landed property prices in Johor may see a maximum 30% dip,\u201d Wee said. He sees this as a \u201c\u201cmarket self-adjustment\u201d. \u201cProperties there were so hot and selling at quite a high price so even if landed residential property prices drop another 20%, [I] think the market would still be healthy,\u201d Wee noted. He said about 13,000 landed housing units are coming into the market in 2017/2018. \u201cAlthough landed homes are still in demand, the absorption speed can\u2019t beat the incoming supply.\u201d Nonetheless, he remains optimistic about new projects with units priced around RM400,000 to RM600,000. Wee was one of the speakers at the summit organised by the Association of Valuers, Property Managers, Estate Agents and Property Consultants in the Private Sector Malaysia held yesterday at the Sime Darby Convention Centre, Kuala Lumpur. The market will be even tougher for the non-landed residential segment. \u201cThere are about 25,000 units flooding the market this year, next year will be another 24,000 units. The oversupply issue is not only causing stagnant sales, it has also affected the prices of existing stock, he said during his presentation on the \u201cSouthern region market performance and outlook\u201d\u2019at the summit. His data showed that five of the most established high-rise residential projects in Johor have experienced price drops since 2014. \u201cFor example, Aloha Tower which used to sell at RM215.90 psf in 2010 and peaked at RM388.66 psf in 2014 was selling at RM315.02 psf last year. And Aloha Tower is not the only victim.\u201d (See chart below.)  Meanwhile, the industrial property segment in Johor is also seeing poor occupancy. As at 3Q2016, there were some 11,578 existing stock in Johor Bahru and Kulaijaya. \u201cAs you pass by the industrial areas in Johor, you will see many for sale or to let stickers on the properties, and I think we are going to see more because there will be more incoming supply,\u201d he said. However, there are some exceptional cases such as I-Park @ Senai Airport City. \u201cThe key success factors are build-and-sell or build-and-lease-type properties. I think this is the way to go, at least for the next two years.\u201d Other than that, he held a positive view on the much-talked-about Forest City project by China developer Country Garden. \u201cIt is a project that targets foreign buyers so it will not have a direct impact on other local projects.

That outstrips the benchmark FBM KLCI\u2019s 1.8% rise from end-December to end-January. The rally is driven by renewed expectations of an eventual Sime Darby Bhd demerger, plans for which the group finally announced on Jan 26. It is seeking to spin off the plantation and property divisions while keeping its other three core businesses under the current listed entity. The stock soared to close at a nine-year high of RM9.27 apiece the next day, a level unseen since January 2008. Meanwhile, its investment bank-issued structural warrant, Sime-C8, jumped six sen or 24.5% to 30.5 sen on the same day. The warrant closed at 28 sen last Tuesday. Out of Sime Darby\u2019s six outstanding warrants, C8 is the cheapest bet on a value-enhancing demerger with the smallest premium to the mother share. It has the second longest expiry date \u2014 July 31, 2017 \u2014 with a 5:1 conversion ratio and RM7.75 strike price. Analysts had 10 \u201cbuy\u201d calls versus eight \u201chold\u201d and three \u201csell\u201d ratings, according to Bloomberg data at the time of writing. Among the \u201cbuy\u201d calls, target prices ranged from JP Morgan\u2019s RM9 to KAF\u2019s RM10. Out of 21 calls, 17 were last updated last month. Many analysts are positive on the plantation spin-off, as the sector is seen to be heading for better times ahead. In a Jan 26 research note, JP Morgan says it expects the plantation sector\u2019s earnings to recover moving forward, and that Sime Darby Plantation\u2019s asset valuations are discounted by as much as 45% to its closest large-cap peers. UOB Kay Hian previously estimated the plantation unit could fetch a valuation of over RM50 billion, more than four-fifths of Sime Darby\u2019s market capitalisation, or RM60.6 billion. If the stock rebounds to RM9, the C8 warrant would theoretically be worth 25 sen apiece. At RM9.15 per mother share, the warrant would then cost nothing in theory, with potential upside of 9.3% if the stock rises further to RM10. However, the lifespan of the derivatives is rather short for investors to ride the upside that could result from the conglomerate\u2019s plan, which explains the minimum premium over the mother share. Sime Darby will release its earnings for the second quarter FY2017 ended Dec 31 this month. It pays dividends twice a year, with a policy of paying out at least 50% of net profit.

Nomura Research said the de-rating could arise after the separate listings of its plantation and property divisions. \u201cThese divisions are the key earnings drivers and account for around 80% of our sum-of-parts valuation for Sime Darby. \u201cIn our view, a further collaboration of companies under the Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) group is likely as PNB holds a 40.8% stake in Sime [Darby] and a 42% stake in UMW Holdings Bhd, which is involved in similar businesses as Sime\u2019s [Darby] trading and logistics division. \u201cIt is also possible that there is further collaboration and/or consolidation between Sime\u2019s [Darby] property division and S P Setia Bhd given PNB\u2019s 56.8% stake in S P Setia,\u201d Nomura added in a Jan 27 note. UOB Kay Hian said the current premium price-earnings (PE) ratio multiple that Sime Darby is trading at might be at risk of rerating to a lower PE multiple after the new plantation and property listings. \u201cIts other businesses will not fetch a rich valuation, more so with the near-term business outlook for automotive, industrial and ports remaining relatively weak. \u201cHowever, the final outcome and potential value creation still depends on the restructuring structure,\u201d the firm said in a Jan 27 note. UOB Kay Hian added that if crude palm oil prices remain high and recovery of production comes in stronger-than-expected, then a high value can be derived from the plantation listing. To recap, Sime Darby announced on Jan 26 its plan to create pure plays to unlock value for the group. The exercise could see the plantation and property pure plays listed on Bursa Malaysia as Sime Darby Plantation Bhd and Sime Darby Property Bhd respectively, while the group\u2019s trading and logistics business will remain under Sime Darby which will retain its listed status. JP Morgan Asia Pacific Equity Research, in its Jan 26 note, said that among the risks to the demerger strategy is a holding company discount to its asset value for Sime Darby. \u201c[A] holding company discount [could] potentially emerge but Sime [Darby] shareholders, we believe, may be compensated with shares in the plantation listed co and/or higher dividends post demerger as in the case of IOI\u2019s [Corp Bhd] demerger of its property unit in 2014,\u201d said JP Morgan. It noted another factor that could pose a risk is Sime Darby\u2019s low return on equity (ROE) of 5%. \u201cSime\u2019s [Darby has a] low ROE at 5%, [based on financial year ending June 30, 2017 (FY17) estimates] versus 10% to 14% for IOI and Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd. \u201c[However] we believe earnings for Sime [Darby] have bottomed, after two consecutive years of sharp core earnings decline of over 30% compound annual growth rate over FY15 to FY16. \u201cQuarterly results, hence, will be key to watch where a recovery in plantation earnings will strengthen the case for value unlocking on asset valuations,\u201c it added. In its Jan 27 note on Sime Darby, Kenanga Research said the group could raise some RM27.2 billion from the pure play exercise. \u201cBased on our speculated scenario, where Sime [Darby] maintains a 51% stake in each entity, we estimate some RM27.2 billion [could be raised] from this exercise, with plantation fetching RM19.4 billion and property raising RM 7.8 billion. \u201cThis represents cash per share of RM4.10 \u2026 Assuming Sime [Darby] retains 50% of funds raised and pays out the rest as dividends, this could represent a bumper dividend of RM2 per share or 22% of current share price,\u201d Kenanga said. The firm opined that Sime Darby\u2019s move to unlock shareholder value is an exciting rerating catalyst considering the potential for a substantial cash payout while maintaining business as usual in the respective segments.

For the longest time, the spotlight has been firmly on its 20% associate, Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd (FGV), which appears beset with numerous worries \u2014 ageing trees, volatile crude palm oil (CPO) prices, a depreciating ringgit, fraud at its Turkish unit \u2014 in total, a challenging situation. FGV was floated at RM4.55 apiece in June 2012 and since mid-2014, its share price has been spiralling downwards, reaching its current level of less than RM1.60, largely as a result of weak sentiment. The company went on an acquisition spree from its listing up to 2015, signing deals that drew much criticism for their high valuations. FELDA itself has been grappling with incessant politicking as its settlements stretch over 54 constituencies deep in the Malay heartland, which has long been seen as a vote bank for the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition. With the 14th general election likely to take place this year or at the latest in August 2018, FELDA and its units are bound to attract much attention. A few weeks ago, the Auditor-General\u2019s Report 2015 revealed that the planning, implementation, monitoring and management of projects by FELDA and its subsidiaries were unsatisfactory. The AG recommended that FELDA plan its procurement and management of projects comprehensively to ensure proper implementation and avoid wastage, and carry out feasibility studies and due diligence before participating in any investment or project, which are the basics of any business. It is worth noting that FELDA is not on a sound financial footing (see \u201cAgency worse off than before FGV listing\u201d). Now with its proposed acquisition \u2014 its largest to date \u2014 of 37% equity interest in Indonesian planter PT Eagle High Plantations Tbk for a whopping US$505.4 million, the authority is likely to continue to hog the limelight. It is paying IDR580 per share for Eagle High when the counter was trading at only IDR298 when the deal was announced. FELDA is buying the stake from Rajawali Group, which is owned by Indonesian businessman Tan Sri Peter Sondakh, who is said to be close to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak. Such a high price for a non-controlling stake in a loss-making group has become a point of contention. A source close to FELDA, however, reveals that the final quarter of 2016 has been a good one for Eagle High, making it likely that the company will perform from now on. Responding to its critics, FELDA said enterprise value per hectare, and not share price, was a more accurate measurement \u2014 Eagle High\u2019s EV/ha is US$16,000. It also noted that Sime Darby Bhd concluded the purchase of New Britain Palm Oil Ltd (NBPOL) at an EV/ha of US$27,000 while Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd\u2019s planned acquisition of MP Evans, at US$15,500 EV/ha, was rejected by the latter. MP Evans\u2019 independent valuation was US$17,300 EV/ha but the board was looking at US$24,000 EV/ha. MP Evans is also much smaller with a planted area of 31,400ha while Eagle High\u2019s planted area is 125,000ha. \u201cSo FELDA is purchasing access to land four times the size of MP Evans at a lower EV/ha than MP Evans\u2019 independent valuation,\u201d the statutory body said. FELDA officials, meanwhile, are bound by a non-disclosure agreement with Eagle High, which is listed on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, preventing them from revealing important details that they say would justify the high price. \u201cThere is still the approval from the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture [yet to be obtained]. This is applied for only after a conditional sales and purchase [agreement] is signed. So, it\u2019s like a chicken-and-egg situation. They (FELDA and Eagle High) have to make an announcement to the stock exchange while they can\u2019t disclose many salient points of the deal,\u201d a source familiar with FELDA\u2019s deal tells The Edge. He says there are safety nets in place that he cannot reveal but when these are made known, he adds, critics of the deal will see the acquisition price is actually fair. Also, the safety nets ensure that FELDA does not end up with the short end of the stick. \u201cIt\u2019s like a profit guarantee [from Eagle High and Rajawali Group] that secures FELDA,\u201d he says without elaborating. However, he confirms news reports that FELDA will be getting a loan from the government and that there are guarantees in place to ensure that Eagle High and Rajawali Group perform, and if they do not, FELDA will be compensated. \u201cIt\u2019s not as good as a soft loan but it is better than a commercial one. These are the best terms FELDA could get.\u201d It also does not help that Rajawali Group is said to have acquired Eagle High at a cheaper price (see next page). Nevertheless, the arguments of both the proponents \u2014 for now only a small group of FELDA officials \u2014 and the many detractors have their merits. \u00a0 Merits for FELDA The source familiar with FELDA says the deal is a good opportunity for the government agency, given the lack of available plantation land in the country. Furthermore, the Indonesian government is making an exception by allowing FELDA to buy a chunk of Eagle High. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to get such a large piece of plantation land \u2014 it\u2019s scarce now. This is a long-term investment. Moreover, the Indonesian government seems to be clamping down on the sale of large land banks,\u201d the source adds. In a news release on Christmas day defending the acquisition, the statutory body said, \u201cThis is the last opportunity for FELDA/Malaysia or any other foreign party to acquire an Indonesian company with massive land bank \u2026 the Indonesian government made a one-off exception in this deal.\u201d While Eagle High\u2019s planted area is 125,000ha, its total land bank is more than 400,000ha. Even though the US$505.4 million price takes into account only the 125,000ha that are already planted, the green light has already been given for the planting of some 300,000ha. The source says apart from palm oil production, Rajawali Group is involved in many other businesses in which FELDA could participate but he refrains from further speculation. \u201cWhat FELDA and Eagle High are planning now is all very fluid but the main aim is to stabilise CPO prices.\u201d While Malaysia and Indonesia produce 85% of the world\u2019s CPO, neither has been able to hold sway over its price. It is hoped that with the creation of the Council of Palm Oil Producing Countries (CPOPC) and with FELDA and Eagle High playing a key role in it, the price of the commodity could be steadied. Furthermore, the CPOPC could put a stop to Indonesian companies undercutting their Malaysian counterparts in selling CPO to China. \u201cThe undercutting will end if we have a collaboration with Eagle High. There will be a stop to undercutting, which in turn will stabilise CPO prices,\u201d the source says. There is also the notion that buying into Eagle High will open up the Indonesian market to FELDA. \u201cThere will be a lot of collaborations and cross-selling between potentially new businesses and synergies for FELDA in seedling, fertiliser, CPO trading, downstream, oleochemicals and others,\u201d the source adds. \u00a0 What merits? Much of the criticism of the acquisition stems from the purportedly high price being forked out by FELDA. A market watcher familiar with the FELDA deal says, \u201cAs at 9M2016, Eagle High made a net loss of IDR300.35 billion (RM100 million or US$22 million) and was highly geared at 1.32 times. Thus, I think Eagle High is unlikely to pay dividends for FY2016. \u201cAssuming that the acquisition is 100% funded by debt and a borrowing rate of 3% of US$505.4 million, the borrowing cost of US$15 million or RM68 million could eat into FELDA\u2019s cash flow. Simply put, without an underlying cash flow from the investment, FELDA might have to tap its cash flow to pay interest obligations instead of the settlers.\u201d He disputes FELDA\u2019s contention that share price is not an accepted valuation method. \u201cShare price may not be an accepted valuation method if the buyer acquires a controlling stake, like in the case of KLK\u2019s proposed conditional takeover of MP Evans. Also, the pricing for MP Evans takes into the consideration the location of its estates, next to KLK\u2019s \u2026 [similarly] Sime Darby acquired 100% of NBPOL. \u201cIn FELDA\u2019s case, it is not acquiring a controlling stake. Post-acquisition, Rajawali Group would own 37.07% while it would own 37%. In FELDA\u2019s case, it would have little influence and, worse still, it might need to inject funds into Eagle High should the cash flow remain a problem. \u201cFELDA might report a loss on the investment of as much as RM1 billion or US$242 million if it marked to market the investment. How does FELDA plan to recoup the losses from this investment?\u201d he asks. He goes on to say that scarcity should not be confused with a purchase with no control and no foreseeable cash flow to service debt obligations. Also, there is a rule that foreigners with more than 100,000ha of estates in Indonesia are not allowed to expand. This, coupled with the illiquidity of Eagle High\u2019s shares and this being a one-off exception, suggests that FELDA might not be able to divest its investment. Furthermore, has FELDA explored other avenues? Companies such as Sime Darby and Wilmar International Ltd might be willing to part with 37% of their estates, which are profitable, at similar prices. The source says while Malaysia is a major oil palm player in Indonesia, the republic\u2019s consumer market is dominated by the likes of Wilmar International, Golden Agri-Resources Ltd and Indofood Agri Resources Ltd, and he does not see much synergy. FELDA might face difficulty in implementing any collaborative plans, he adds. \u201cAs FELDA\u2019s stake in Eagle High would not be a controlling one, it is unlikely to change Malaysian palm oil companies\u2019 controlling holdings in Indonesia.\u201d Nevertheless, more details of the deal could come to light as early as next week with some form of response from the Indonesian government. Until then, however, naysayers will continue to cast aspersions on the deal. \u00a0"}, "112": {"date_posted": "10/1/2017", "title": "Sime Darby within the upward channel, says AllianceDBS Research", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 10): AllianceDBS Research said Sime Darby Bhd was within the upward channel and that Sime Darby had on Jan 9 traded lower to settle at the day\u2019s low of RM8.45 (down 10 sen or 1.17%).

Last Friday, Hovid announced a recall of its Ternolol 50mg film-coated tablets manufactured under batch number BG04645 bearing manufacturing date April 2016, for the Malaysian market. The recall was apparently due to a labelling mix-up. The batch for recall contains boxes labelled as \"Ternolol 50\" but some of the blisters referred to the product as \"Ternolol Tab 100mg\".

The group's solicitors, Shearn Delamore & Co, has advised that the company is not obliged to pay the sum owing under the facilities, given that a provision under the settlement agreement (SA) inked with the creditors in 2013 stated that the appropriate remedy for the bondholders is to instruct MTB to pursue RM17 million from three entities for the breach of the SA, namely Hoe Leong Corp Ltd, Setinggi Holdings Ltd and/or Hoe Leong's nominee.

One of the key themes that will come into play in 2017 will be the US President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s policies as well as a possible increase in the pace of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve. This would lead to a stronger US dollar that could benefit some of the export players. Thematic investing continues to include construction plays with the rollout of new major infrastructure projects in the country. There has also been a rising earnings prospect for the plantation sector as crude palm oil price remains high and output is expected to improve moving into the second half of 2017. The oil and gas sector also sees a gradual improvement in sentiment following the gradual recovery in oil prices after the deal on production cut between the Opec and non-Opec members. Higher tourist arrivals with 2017 being [email\u00a0protected] Year and as Malaysia plays host to the 2017 Southeast Asian Games and Asean Para Games could also benefit airlines, gaming and leisure sectors. A possible early general election in the country could also give a boost to the market. With external headwinds remaining dominant driving volatility, a defensive strategy remains prominent for the Malaysian equity markets. The Edge Financial Daily has compiled a list of stock picks based on these investment themes. \u00a0 Inari Amertron Bhd Inari Amertron Bhd is expected to return to double-digit growth as analysts are positive about the impact from the iPhone\u2019s 10th anniversary that is expected to see something major planned by Apple Inc for the device. Bloomberg data shows earnings per share for the financial year ending June 30, 2017 (FY17) is expected to grow by 23.4% year-on-year, while revenue will see an increase of 21.9%. The consensus 12-month target price for Inari is at RM3.73, indicating a potential upside of 12.3% from its last closing price on Dec 30, 2016 at RM3.32. Ten out of 12 research houses give a \u201cbuy\u201d call on the semiconductor player. Inari is the leading radio frequency (RF) test house with a solid working relationship with Broadcom, also a leader in the RF industry, which has a three-year supply agreement with Apple until 2018. Inari is expected to benefit from this. Meanwhile, the risk and fear of how Trump\u2019s protectionism policy might affect Inari have also been slightly overdone, according to Affin Hwang Asset Management head of equity strategies and advisory, Gan Eng Peng, as near-term changes are likely to be minimal. The group\u2019s FY16 saw a decline of 2.81% in its net profit to RM148.3 million from RM152.5 million in FY15 despite a revenue growth of 11.6% to RM1.04 billion during the same period. However, its latest financial results for the first quarter ended Sept 30, 2016 (1QFY17) saw its net profit return to growth, with an increase of 5.5% to RM48 million from RM45.5 million in 1QFY16. \u2014 By Billy Toh \u00a0 Magni-Tech Industries Bhd Magni-Tech Industries Bhd, the largest original equipment manufacturer for Nike in Malaysia for apparel products, could ride on the sportswear giant\u2019s impressive growth story as Nike\u2019s latest second quarter for fiscal year 2017 beat estimates on both sales and earnings per share. Last year, Magni-Tech\u2019s share price performance was disappointing as it fell by 6.47% to close at RM4.19 on the last day of 2016 despite an increase of 31.9% in its net profit for the second financial quarter ended Oct 31, 2016 to RM28.5 million. Inter-Pacific Research Sdn Bhd has maintained its \u201cbuy\u201d call on the apparel manufacturer with a target price of RM5.72, indicating a 36.5% upside from its last closing price on Dec 30, 2016. With a price-earnings ratio of about 8.5 times (below the industry\u2019s average of 9.3 times) and a strong balance sheet, the year ahead looks bright for Magni-Tech although Inter-Pacific Research cautioned that upside might take some time to materialise. It has zero debt with a total cash holding of RM62.6 million and RM74.1 million invested in investment securities. With its dividend yield of about 3% expected to continue, its proven track record in the industry, excellent balance sheet, a stronger US dollar and an expected earnings growth riding on Nike, Magni-Tech could just entice investors to give it a second thought for 2017 after being overlooked for most of 2016. \u2014 By Billy Toh \u00a0 CLASSIC Scenic Bhd CLASSIC Scenic Bhd, the wooden picture frame manufacturer, is the classic dividend play for 2017 with its above market average dividend yield of about 7%, and might be the right defensive strategy amid the uncertain external environment. Last year, its share price performance was impressive with a total return of 59.8%, closing at RM1.79 on the last trading day of 2016. What\u2019s even more remarkable is that despite such an uptrend, its dividend yield for 2016 was above market average at 6.7%. The group saw its revenue rise 22.7% year-on-year to RM14 million for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2016, while net profit grew 87.5% to RM3.2 million. Its gross profit margin also rose to 43.9% from 38.2% a year ago. The company is primarily involved in the manufacturing and export of high-end wooden picture framework mouldings and about 90% of its sales come from the export market, mainly to the US and is denominated in US dollars. The stronger US dollar has contributed to its improved financial results. Its net cash also saw a significant increase to RM28.7 million or 23.9 sen per share from RM21.4 million in 2015. The company operates six manufacturing factories and is in the midst of building a new warehouse to improve its production efficiency and capacity. InsiderAsia has noted some of the positive characteristics of Classic Scenic, such as its profitable niche market, owner-oriented management, high sustainable dividend yield and growth potential. \u2014 By Billy Toh \u00a0 Gamuda Bhd Gamuda Bhd has significant upside due to its strong outstanding order book of RM9 billion, supported by the MMC-Gamuda joint venture which secured the RM15.5 billion mass rapid transit (MRT) Line 2 underground works package in March 2016, according to TA Securities. \u201cWe expect close to RM500 million of project development partner (PDP) fee to flow directly to profit before tax throughout the implementation of [the] MRT Line 2,\u201d the research house said in a report. Other catalysts include Gamuda\u2019s works package for Pan Borneo Highway worth RM1.57 billion and the appointment of SRS Consortium, in which Gamuda has a 60% stake, as the PDP for the Penang Transport Master Plan (PTMP). TA Securities has estimated that the alternative proposal adopted by the Penang state government has a projected value of RM40 billion, with works targeted to commence in 2018. The potential sale of Gamuda\u2019s 40% stake in the Syarikat Pengeluar \u00a0Air Sungai Selangor water supply concession should provide the funding for its PTMP project, said AffinHwang Capital. Shares in Gamuda have a 12-month target price of RM5.46 according to consensus estimates. Of the 23 analysts covering the company, 18 have rated a \u201cbuy\u201d call on the stock, while three have a \u201chold\u201d call. Bloomberg data projects a 7.05% growth in earnings per share (EPS) for the construction player for its financial year ending July 31, 2017 and a further 13.17% EPS growth for the following year. \u2014 By Samantha Ho \u00a0 Sime Darby Bhd Sime Darby Bhd, which recently saw Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar take up the helm of its controlling shareholder, Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB), is set to benefit from a \u00a0proposed corporate restructuring exercises. \u201cThe expectation is that [Wahid] will unlock value [via] restructuring,\u201d a head of research said. PNB had a 52.98% stake in Sime Darby as at Nov 30, 2016, according to the group\u2019s website. Sime Darby was also highlighted as one of CIMB Research\u2019s big cap picks in their strategy note on Dec 2. \u201cWe expect the share price to rerate on potential plans to unlock value and better earnings prospects in view of the higher crude palm oil and coal prices in the future quarters,\u201d CIMB Research said. Shares in Sime Darby have shot up from an opening price of RM8.10 this year to RM8.55 at market close last Friday, suggesting investors had already begun pricing in expectations on the stock. \u2014 By Samantha Ho \u00a0 Genting Malaysia Bhd Genting Malaysia Bhd has been touted as a darling of the gaming industry for 2017 on expectations that the Genting Integrated Tourism Plan (GITP) will boost its earnings and improve market sentiment due to the legalisation of casino operations in Japan. Research houses have pointed to expected higher visitor growth as the main catalyst for the stock in light of the full launch of the first phase of the GITP by end-2017, which includes the opening of the 20th Century Fox theme park. The consensus 12-month target price for Genting Malaysia is RM5.13 based on estimates by 17 out of 23 investors. The stock was last traded at RM4.73, edging up from its 2017 opening price of RM4.58. Fourteen analysts have placed a \u201cbuy\u201d call on the stock, while seven have recommended to \u201chold\u201d. According to consensus estimates by Bloomberg, the group is expected to see a growth in its earnings per share by 13.2% for its financial year ending Dec 31, 2017. Revenue is also expected to post growth of 9.35% and 9.3% by end-2017 and end-2018 respectively. In the current quarter, the group is expected to complete the launches of Sky Avenue and Sky Plaza, which have been fully tenanted at premium rental rates of RM20 per sq ft, according to Maybank Kim Eng\u2019s strategy report dated Dec 19. The weaker ringgit is also expected to be a pull factor for Chinese tourists, whose arrivals had been trending upwards by 26% in the cumulative first eight months of 2016, Maybank Kim Eng said. \u2014 By Samantha Ho \u00a0 Ta Ann Holdings Bhd After a year of lacklustre performance, Sarawak-based Ta Ann Holdings Bhd is set to benefit from the improved demand for timber as well as the turnaround in the plantation sector. The company has been chosen by Kenanga Research, AffinHwang Capital and Public Investment Bank Research as their stock picks for 2017 in their latest strategy reports. KAF Investment Bank chief investment officer Gan Kong Yik likes Ta Ann as he is upbeat about the plantation sector in 2017 with crude palm oil (CPO) price expected to be firmer. Furthermore, the demand for timber is anticipated to increase in 2017. Another plus point for Ta Ann is that it is seen as a beneficiary from the stronger US dollar. In a strategy note dated Jan 4, Kenanga Research expects Ta Ann to be \u201ca double beneficiary of the sharp CPO price appreciation, as well as stronger US dollar\u201d as the company exports nearly all of its timber products, and sales are denominated in US dollars while costs are entirely in ringgit terms. It also likes Ta Ann for its sector-leading dividend yield of 3.8% against the average 2.4%. The consensus 12-month target price for Ta Ann is at RM4.38. Six out of nine research houses covering the stock have given it a \u201cbuy\u201d call. The integrated timber producer did not perform well in 2016, falling 5.5% over the past year, underperforming the benchmark FBM KLCI, which declined by 3%. \u2014 By Yimie Yong \u00a0 SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd Integrated oil and gas (O&G) services provider SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the oil production cut pledge between Opec and non-Opec members. The deal is expected to start a cyclical recovery for the O&G sector and SapuraKencana is viewed as a good proxy to ride on the gradual recovery of the sector. Several research houses have upgraded their call on the O&G sector recently, after Opec and non-Opec members pledged to cut production. Chosen as one of the stock picks for 2017 by Public Investment Bank Research, the research house said the worst is likely behind for SapuraKencana. Given its ability to undertake comprehensive scope of works across the O&G suite, SapuraKencana is said to stand in a better position against its peers on expected recovery in O&G activities. Maybank IB Research has pointed out that SapuraKencana is a proxy to a rising oil price play and monetising its gas assets is a major catalyst. The counter is one of its key buys in the sector. Kenanga Research has recently upgraded SapuraKencana to an \u201coutperform\u201d call with a target price of RM1.88, following the rerating on the selective upstream players in view of the sustainability of oil prices above US$50 (RM236) per barrel. Bloomberg data shows that there are five research houses with a \u201cbuy\u201d call on the stock, and 12 with a \u201chold\u201d call. Recall that the counter fell by nearly 20% in 2016 and has plummeted by almost 63% in the last three years. \u2014 By Yimie Yong \u00a0 Bumi Armada Bhd Bumi Armada Bhd, which saw its share price fall more than 40%, may provide another opportunity for investors in anticipation of improving sentiment and operating outlook of the oil and gas sector. TA Investment Management Bhd executive director Choo Swee Kee pointed out that Bumi Armada shares were oversold in the past two years and expected there would be strong earnings growth for its floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) business. \u201cBumi Armada is one of our top picks for 2017. Moving forward, we think there will be stronger earnings growth for the FPSO. We also like earnings generated from the FPSO as they are seen as more stable,\u201d he told The Edge Financial Daily. Bumi Armada is one of the world\u2019s largest FPSO players. Public Investment Bank, which has a \u201cbuy\u201d call on the counter, expects to see a boost in earnings from four major FPSO & floating gas solutions (FGS) contributions in 2017, according to its note dated Nov 24, 2016. Bumi Armada posted a net loss of RM96.71 milion in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2016 (3QFY16) versus a net profit of RM70 million a year earlier, on lower revenue. Revenue fell 33% to RM377.51 million in 3QFY16 from RM559.46 million in 3QFY15, as it saw lower income from FGS and FPSO operations. Despite weaker earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) level, UOB Kay Hian said it had assessed that there was no cause for concern as Bumi Armada was still well within the allowable range for loan covenant on net debt/Ebitda. \u2014 By Yimie Yong \u00a0 Protasco Bhd Protasco Bhd is one of the construction players that are expected to benefit from an early general election in 2017. The well-established player in the construction industry is focused on road maintenance works, where most of them are based on concessions awarded by state and federal governments, providing the company with a steady income stream. With the heightened expectation of the 14th general election happening in 2017, there is a potential for \u00a0extra emergency road maintenance works to be carried out, according to Kenanga Research. Protasco has an outstanding order book of about RM4.4 billion for its maintenance concessions, which could last for about 10 years, contributing about RM400 million to its revenue yearly. Looking forward, Protasco is eyeing more sizeable concessions, which could potentially contribute another RM100 million to RM200 million to its top-line. For its construction division, management is targeting a replenishment of about RM500 million for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2017 that comprises infrastructure and government housing projects such as Perumahan Penjawat Awam 1Malaysia (PPA1M). Protasco has a strong track record with PPA1M project, in which the company has bagged two phases of PPA1M worth RM900 million. Besides a steady income stream, the group also has a decent dividend yield of about 5.6%, far superior in comparison with other small- to mid-cap construction players with an average of 2.9%. \u2014 By Billy Toh"}, "115": {"date_posted": "29/12/2016", "title": "No synergy seen in Felda\u2019s Eagle High buy", "article": " \u00a0 KUALA LUMPUR: More questions are being raised on the rationale for the purchase of a 37% non-controlling stake by Federal Land Development Authority (Felda) in Indonesia\u2019s PT Eagle High Plantations Tbk as there would be no unlocking of value for Felda. In fact, the US$505.4 million or RM2.26 billion investment should be spent on Felda\u2019s locally listed arm Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd (FGV). \u201cFelda is not acquiring a controlling stake in Eagle High [and] it cannot effect a mandatory general offer. As a result, Felda cannot derive synergy from the buy unlike Sime Darby Bhd\u2019s acquisition of New Britain Palm Oil Ltd (NBPOL). \u201cSince there is no asset [but] only a stake, Felda cannot unlock the value from this exercise,\u201d an analyst with a local bank, who declined to be quoted, said. The analyst added that the acquisition at US$505.4 million by Felda\u2019s FIC Properties Sdn Bhd (FICP), which is more than double the average share price of Eagle High, is a significant premium and therefore \u201ctoo pricey\u201d for a loss-making company. The analyst told The Edge Financial Daily via telephone that FICP\u2019s buy at 580 rupiah (19 sen) per share is expensive and it would take Felda a \u201clong time\u201d before it can reap profits partly because the shares are illiquid. \u201cAccording to Eagle High\u2019s financial results for [the] first nine months of 2016, it made a loss. The cost of 580 rupiah per share is more than 100% of the average share price. Eagle High\u2019s share price would have to double before Felda\u2019s investment can break even. \u201cThat is the only way I see Felda benefiting from the acquisition because it has no control over the management. It might be looking to benefit through dividends with crude palm oil (CPO) price surging beyond RM4,000 per tonne. \u201cHowever, the prospect [of that happening] at this moment is not likely. It will be a long time before Felda sees any benefit,\u201d the analyst said. Last Friday, FICP inked a sale and purchase agreement with PT Rajawali Corp to acquire the stake in Jakarta-listed Eagle High, which is also one of Indonesia\u2019s largest palm oil companies. Eagle High, which is 74.07% owned by PT Rajawali, saw net loss widen to RM100 million in its nine months ended Sept 30, 2016 (9MFY16) from RM27.4 million last year due to weak fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production and sizeable interest expenses while revenue dipped 22.5% to RM532.7 million compared with RM685.8 million in 9MFY15. According to filings with the Indonesia Stock Exchange, the company suffered a net loss of RM60 million on higher revenue of about RM900 million in its financial year ended Dec 31, 2015 (FY15) versus RM63.1 million net loss and RM765.7 million revenue in FY14. Asked if the acquisition constituted a \u201cbad call\u201d, the analyst said the question should instead be why Felda was \u201cdesperate\u201d to buy a stake in Eagle High. \u201cThe investment by Felda was better spent on FGV which has a lower enterprise value per hectare (EV/ha). \u201cThis is a decision made by a government entity [so] they must justify the desperate need for this acquisition,\u201d the analyst said. To recap, in a seven-point frequently asked questions (FAQs) response last Friday, Felda said the deal will improve Felda\u2019s crop profile as the average age of Eagle High\u2019s trees is seven years versus Felda\u2019s 15 years. \u201cThere would be a lot of collaborations and cross-selling between Felda and Eagle High. Potential new businesses and synergies for Felda Group in seedling, fertiliser, crude palm oil trading, downstream/oleochemical, and potential entry to the vast Indonesian market of 260 million people for Felda Group\u2019s finished and consumer products,\u201d Felda said. Meanwhile, PT RHB Securities Indonesia analyst Hariyanto Wijaya opined that Felda\u2019s acquisition price at 580 rupiah per share versus the current price of 298 rupiah and potential earnings recovery could be a catalyst for unlocking Eagle High\u2019s share price. \u201cWe met with its investor relations personnel last week and the management estimates its FFB production in the fourth quarter of 2016 (4Q16) and FY17 to grow by 12% year-on-year (y-o-y) and 30% y-o-y, respectively. \u201cThey also guided on continued production recovery since September, and that the current CPO price level should enable Eagle High to book positive earnings in 4Q16. We do not have a rating on the stock. At current EV/ha of US$10,069, it is trading at the lower range of our plantations universe,\u201d he said in a sector note on Tuesday. Hariyanto added that in 2016, about 73,167ha or 64.5% of Eagle High\u2019s nucleus matured plantation of 113,432ha was in the increasing FFB yield phase (aged four to eight years). The alleged expensive acquisition has been the subject of controversy among several quarters including CIMB Group Holdings Bhd chairman Datuk Seri Nazir Razak, opposition politicians and researchers. Among their criticisms, they claim that Felda should not validate the soundness of the purchase on the basis of EV/ha as it did not own a controlling shareholding in Eagle High. PKR policymaker Mohd Rafizi Ramli told a press conference yesterday that Felda was using EV/ha justification on the basis of how much value one can get from planted acreage. \u201cFelda reasoned that it is almost impossible to find huge acreage of that size in Indonesia because nobody is going to sell. Now, firstly, you are not in control of Eagle High Plantations, Felda plans to buy a 37% stake at exorbitant price, yet at the same time it does not have the controlling stake. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have a controlling stake, it is rather ridiculous to have access to huge acreage of plantation. Value can only be added when there is synergy through a controlling stake,\u201d he said. According to reports, PT Rajawali founder Peter Sondakh will retain a controlling stake in Eagle High. In its FAQs response, Felda stated Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd\u2019s recent final offer of US$15,500 EV/ha rejected by MP Evans Group plc\u2019s board of directors was valued by MP Evans\u2019 independent valuers as US$17,300 EV/ha. \u201cMP Evans asked for valuation of US$24,000 EV/ha for the company. [However,] at US$505.4 million, Felda is purchasing the Eagle High stake at US$16,000 EV/ha,\u201d Felda said, adding that MP Evans\u2019 planted land is 31,400ha while Eagle High\u2019s planted area is 125,000ha. \u201cFelda is purchasing access to land four times the size of MP Evans at a lower EV/ha than MP Evans\u2019 independent valuation,\u201d Felda said while noting that Sime Darby\u2019s purchase of NBPOL was at an EV/ha of US$27,000. To this, Mohd Rafizi said Felda should talk about the synergistic value it can get from the acquisition that can put it or FGV in a game-changing position against its competitors. \u201cBuying 37% at that exorbitant price and not even able to consolidate Eagle High\u2019s results into Felda, is just madness. So what will happen is Felda will continue to show a weak balance sheet, so it is pointless to talk about the EV[/ha] because you can\u2019t consolidate. \u201cSimilar to what is happening now where Felda can only take dividend [although] its top results and balance sheet are still weak but with additional RM2 billion debt [due to the acquisition], with no result to show apart from the dividend every now and then. \u201cTherefore, don\u2019t even begin talking about EV[/ha] because it is only relevant when you have control to do with all those acreage you get,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Bernama has reported that Felda\u2019s decision to acquire a stake in Eagle High was vital to its progress as it had reached a stage where it needed to reinvent itself after six decades in the industry. Felda director-general of management Muzamil Mohd Nor said failing to do this would mean Felda would remain stagnant, while others in the global palm oil sector were moving forward. Expounding the rationale behind the transformative deal, Muzamil said the deal was strategically too important to pass up as it would make Felda one of the biggest global palm oil plantation companies. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do this deal, we will just be on the sidelines, being forced to watch our competitors grow by leaps and bounds in this highly lucrative sector,\u201d he said in an interview yesterday."}, "116": {"date_posted": "19/12/2016", "title": "Mitrajaya to bag RM400m job in Ara Damansara", "article": " \u00a0 MITRAJAYA Holdings Bhd is understood to be close to winning a construction job in Ara Damansara after bidding just above RM400 million for it, an industry source reveals. Offered by Sime Darby Ara Damansara Development Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of conglomerate Sime Darby Bhd, the contract entails the development of 756 serviced apartments in four 17-storey blocks, 24 duplexes on nine floors of a podium consisting of serviced apartments, two floors of shopoffices, parking space and common facilities at Lot PT4002, Jalan PJU 1A/41, Ara Damansara. It is learnt that Mitrajaya pipped a number of its peers for the contract because, according to some of the companies it beat, its rate was \u201cvery competitive\u201d. Mitrajaya managing director Tan Eng Piow could not be contacted for comment. If industry players are to be believed, Mitrajaya may not make much in terms of margins due to its competitive price but the contract is expected to strengthen its order book. According to a report by Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd late last week, Mitrajaya\u2019s construction order book stood at RM1.35 billion, providing earnings visibility for another 1\u00bd years. With the Ara Damansara project, its order book would be bumped up to RM1.71 billion. \u201cYear to date, Mitrajaya has secured RM577 million worth of contracts, making up 72% of our RM800 million order book assumption with RM223 million remaining to be achieved. On the back of a RM2 billion tender book, we believe our target is achievable either by year end or early FY2017,\u201d says Kenanga. Some of the notable jobs secured by Mitrajaya last year and early this year are three blocks of 1,062 public apartments (under PPA1M) for Putrajaya Homes; infrastructure works for the Pahang Technology Park in Gambang; civil and infrastructure works for the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development Project in Pengerang, Johor; two blocks of 800 public apartments (under PPA1M) for Putrajaya Homes; and a building complex and external works in Section 13, Petaling Jaya. These are collectively valued at about RM920 million. The company\u2019s three main revenue generators are its construction arm, its property development arm and the Blue Valley Golf and Country Estate in South Africa. Mitrajaya registered record earnings and revenue in its financial year ended Dec 31, 2015, chalking up a net profit of RM86.58 million on revenue of RM890.73 million. Its current year is likely to be just as good with net profit in its first nine months of FY2016 ended Sept 30 coming in at RM74.98 million on sales of RM692.46 million. Annualised, this means Mitrajaya could record as much as RM99.97 million in net profit from RM923.28 million in revenue \u2014 a new record. Kenanga is bullish about the company\u2019s earnings, forecasting a net profit of RM130.1 million on revenue of RM969.7 million in FY2016. It has an \u201coutperform\u201d call on the stock and a target price of RM1.49, which is at a 21% premium to Mitrajaya\u2019s closing price of RM1.23 last Friday. According to Kenanga, its target price implies 11 times FY2017 fully diluted PER (price-earnings ratio), which is in line with the targeted forward PER range of 9 to 13 times for contractors with small to medium market capitalisation. In its notes accompanying its financial results, Mitrajaya says \u201cbarring unforeseen circumstances, the group expects a strong financial performance in FY2016\u201d. As at Sept 30, Mitrajaya had deposits with licensed financial institutions of RM24.32 million, and cash and bank balances of RM20.62 million. On the other side of the balance sheet, it had short-term debt commitments of RM209.06 million and long-term borrowings of RM35.38 million. Mitrajaya\u2019s finance cost for the nine months ended Sept 30 was RM5.7 million. Last week, the company announced that Pentadbir Tanah Kota Tinggi, Johor, had notified it of the compulsory acquisition of almost six acres of its land in Sungai Buntu, Pengerang, south Johor, for the development of the Pengerang Petroleum Complex. The company is being offered RM31.45 million in compensation. The sale puts the land\u2019s value at RM121 psf, which Kenanga views as positive as there are currently no development plans for the land. \u201cThe sale will immediately reduce Mitrajaya\u2019s net gearing to 0.29 times (from 0.35 times as at 3Q2016). Additionally, the sale registers a RM28.8 million gain on disposal on the back of the land\u2019s existing book value of RM10.40 psf,\u201d it says. Mitrajaya\u2019s largest shareholder is Tan with a 40.67% stake. It has no other substantial shareholders."}, "117": {"date_posted": "13/12/2016", "title": "Olam reveals full list of palm suppliers ahead of critical NGO report", "article": " SINGAPORE (Dec 13): Calling itself a \u201csmall player\u201d in third-party palm oil sourcing, Olam International on Monday revealed its full suppliers list, ahead of a report criticising its palm operations in Gabon. In a press release on Monday, Olam says it has been made aware of the report by US-based communications and lobbying company Waxman Strategies, working as Mighty Earth, and Gabon-based NGO Brainforest. Olam adds that it was \u201cdisappointed to see some important factual errors, and several key misinterpretations of Olam\u2019s policies and implementation\u201d. Among the criticisms in the Mighty Report that Olam takes issue with include allegations that the company is deforesting in Gabon and will not sign a no-deforestation commitment that adheres to HCSA (High Carbon Stock Approach) methodology. Olam says it cannot sign up to the no-deforestation commitments due to the lack of available land in Gabon to get high-yielding plantations up and running. Much of Gabon\u2019s non-forested land is infertile savannah or swamps, which makes it necessary to include some highly degraded forest lands, it adds. \u201cWe agree with Gabon\u2019s sovereign right to convert a tiny percentage of its least valuable forested land for agriculture, so long as it is responsibly and transparently done,\u201d Olam says. In addition, Olam also disagreed with Mighty Report\u2019s allegation that its third-party sourcing of palm oil comes from companies that are environmentally destructive and causing fire and haze. Olam says this referred to its palm trading business in Asia. \u201cFor our third party palm sourcing, we are still a small player, accounting for only 0.4% of global palm volumes in 2016,\u201d says Olam Co-Founder and Group CEO Sunny Verghese. \u201cWe already expect full compliance to our Sustainable Palm Oil Policy and Supplier Code, and have absolutely zero tolerance for the burning of forests. All of our current suppliers have either signed this code or have their own codes consistent with ours,\u201d Verghese adds. Olam adds that it had reduced its supplier list from 48 in 2014 to 14 currently, after cutting ties with suppliers who failed to conform to its code of conduct. Olam\u2019s current 14 third-party palm oil suppliers are: 1. Wilmar International 2. Golden Agri-Resources 3. First Resources Limited 4. Inter-Continental Oils & Fats Pte Ltd 5.

Plantation players could ride the recent positive sentiment due to reduced CPO production resulting from El Ni\u00f1o and the likelihood that Malaysia and Indonesia will implement biodiesel mandates. The government is also seeking ways to boost palm oil exports to China following Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak\u2019s visit. Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister Datuk Seri Mah Siew Keong tells The Edge that measures to be taken in the coming months are expected to boost CPO exports to the world\u2019s second largest economy. Palm oil exports to China dropped 42% from January to August, compared with last year, he notes. Malaysia was once China\u2019s largest supplier of palm oil but over the last few years, it has dropped to third place due to increased competition from other edible oils, such as soy and sunflower oil. Indonesia is now the world\u2019s largest palm oil producer. \u201cWe went [to China] and had discussions, asking them to take up more of our palm oil. We hope more companies in China will buy palm oil from Malaysia,\u201d he says over the phone. Mah says the feedback from the Chinese authorities has been positive and believes this will help stop CPO exports to China from further contracting. Indeed, he has seen signs of a pickup recently. Despite the positive catalysts, fund managers and analysts remain sceptical about the demand for palm oil. Furthermore, they find plantation stocks on Bursa Malaysia more expensive in terms of valuation than their peers listed in Singapore and Indonesia. The long-term average price-earnings ratio (PER) of Malaysian planters is 21.1 times while plantation counters in Indonesia and Singapore are trading at PERs of 17.8 and 14.3 times respectively. \u201cPositive factors, such as the supply disruption caused by El Ni\u00f1o, have been largely priced in. The concern is really that demand growth is not really there to excite [the market],\u201d Pheim Asset Management (Asia) Pte Ltd chief investment officer James Lau says in an email reply. He says the continued soft crude oil price does not augur well for the CPO price as it could become a stumbling block, stopping people from switching to biodiesel, unless the government makes its use mandatory. The B10 biodiesel mandate has been delayed several times but sources say there will be progressive rollouts of B10 and B7 blends for the transport and industrial sectors from Dec 1. On efforts to increase palm oil exports to China, Lau says that is good news but it remains to be seen whether this will happen. KAF Investment Funds Bhd chief investment officer Gan Kong Yik concurs, saying that the positive factors have to some extent been priced in when it comes to the valuations of plantation stocks. He has a \u201cneutral\u201d stance on the sector. \u201cIncreased exports to China, I think, is a temporary catalyst. The key is that the global demand for CPO must improve. For investors to turn bullish again, global demand must be strong, and so far, it has not been,\u201d Gan tells The Edge over the phone. He is concerned that the anticipated slower economic growth next year will affect the demand. A plantation analyst with a foreign bank, meanwhile, points out that the valuations of Malaysian plantation stocks are usually higher than in Indonesia and Singapore. As such, he says it might be difficult to justify a \u201cbuy\u201d recommendation for Malaysian plantation counters, adding that most Malaysian planters are trading at a PER of above 20 times. She believes the potential increase in exports to China is positive for Malaysia, but will not change the supply and demand equation, and thus, will not support the CPO price. \u201cIf China is buying more from Malaysia, it means other countries will buy more from Indonesia. It does not change supply and demand,\u201d she tells The Edge. \u201cIncreased demand or a falling supply will be the main factors that will drive the sector. Demand is steady, but supply is plentiful. This time, the CPO price rally is due to a lower supply. When production is normalised, CPO prices will normalise,\u201d she explains. The analyst foresees CPO prices remaining at the current level until the second quarter next year. She forecasts the average CPO price to be at RM2,500 per tonne. According to Bloomberg data, the average price of CPO has been on the rise since August last year. It rebounded 46% to RM2,901.53 on Sept 30, from RM1,982.33 on Aug 31, but retraced to RM2,700 last Thursday. There are, however, fund managers who are still positive on the outlook for the sector. UOB Asset Management executive director and CEO Lim Suet Ling sees near-term potential for planters. \u201cWhile the CPO price has gained about 25% year to date, the Bursa Malaysia Plantation Index has increased only 2%. This could suggest that the rise of the CPO price may not be fully reflected in some plantation companies,\u201d she says via email. The Bursa Malaysia Plantation Index stood at 7,733.898 points last Thursday. Lim expects an increase in palm oil exports to China to be a positive driver for the palm oil sector. Malaysia\u2019s palm oil exports to China YTD have declined about 30%, mainly due to an ample supply of rapeseed oil and soyoil. China has seen increased demand for animal feed, which has led to a jump in soymeal production and its by-product, soyoil. The situation has been exacerbated by an increased supply of rapeseed oil as the Chinese government released stocks from its state reserve programme. Apart from that, the successful implementation of biodiesel mandates by the Malaysian and Indonesian governments would help to provide some support to CPO prices, Lim says. Malaysia currently has a B7 mandate and is targeting to implement a B10 mandate from December. The full implementation of the B10 mandate is expected to consume 1.1 tonnes of CPO, compared with 0.8 tonnes for B7. In Indonesia, it has been reported that the Energy Ministry has made it mandatory for non-subsidised diesel fuel to contain a 20% mix of biodiesel. If successfully implemented, the demand for CPO for biodiesel in the country could more than double. The outlook for CPO prices in the near term will be well supported by the seasonal downward trend in palm oil production as well as the lag effect of El Ni\u00f1o, which is expected to persist until the second quarter of next year, Lim says. CPO prices have risen on the back of a year-on-year decline in production for the first time in the last decade due to dry weather brought about by El Ni\u00f1o. Lim says CPO prices would be higher if not for ample soyoil in the market \u201cas we have seen record soyoil supplies since 2013... Any event (including weather disruption) that affects the supply of other edible oils, including soyoil, would be positive for CPO prices,\u201d she says. Perhaps, investors who bet on plantation counters should be more selective. \u201cWe have been in the market for plantation stocks since last year and our top picks were those with a tree age profile that would support production growth with marginal cost incurrence,\u201d says Pheim Asset Management\u2019s Lau. Following El Ni\u00f1o, however, he is now focusing on plantation companies with strong production recovery supported by prudent management or with appealing dividend yields, such as Genting Plantations Bhd, and non-pure planters like Ta Ann Holdings Bhd and MKH Bhd. From a regional perspective, he says, investors will find \u201ccheaper\u201d plantation stocks in Indonesia, and there has been no adequate explanation for this, although the general refrain has been that Malaysian planters are better managed. Moreover, he believes the gap is not that wide anymore. \u201cAs most of them are trading at PERs above 20 times, age profile and cost of production are key to look at,\u201d Gan says, adding that he prefers plantation players that have a younger tree age profile. He sees Sarawak Palm Oil Bhd as the choice for a longer-term play because of its younger age profile and recent purchase of plantation land, which should bear fruit in the next three years, despite the fact that the group had raised funds for the acquisition. For a short-term play, Gan sees TH Plantations Bhd as a \u201cwarm-up stock\u201d as it has been trading at a five-year low. TH Plantations, which is 74% owned by Lembaga Tabung Haji, saw its share price halved to RM1.13 last Thursday from a five-year high of RM2.23 in March 2012. To Gan, as long as CPO prices remain between RM2,500 and RM2,700 per tonne, it will be positive for most players as their cost of production ranges from RM1,800 to RM1,900 per tonne. Although the plantation analyst with the foreign bank does not have any \u201cbuy\u201d calls on Malaysian planters, she says Sime Darby Bhd could be worth a look as the new chairman of Permodalan Nasional Bhd, Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar, may drive changes at the conglomerate. Sime Darby\u2019s share price has rebounded 18.7% to RM8.24 from its five-year low of RM6.94 on Sept 11 this year, but is still lower than its five-year high of RM9.21 in February last year. \u00a0"}, "124": {"date_posted": "14/11/2016", "title": "Permodalan Nasional eyes listings for Sime Darby units", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 12): Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) is looking at breaking up subsidiary Sime Darby Bhd to unlock the latter's value, The Edge Malaysia business and investment weekly (Edge Weekly) reported in its latest November 14 - 20 issue.

Yinson Holdings Bhd saw the emergence of a new substantial shareholder, Datuk Yeow Kheng Chew, last Monday. He purchased 119.7 million shares or a 10.99% stake in a direct deal at RM3.07 per share or RM367.5 million in total that day. Yeow had previously partnered Tan Sri Mokhzani Mahathir in private investment vehicle Kencana Capital Sdn Bhd, which owned 153.36 million shares or 14% equity interest in Yinson. This stake is now held by Yeow, who bought 119.7 million shares for RM367.5 million from Mokhzani, and had 33.7 million shares distributed to him in specie by Kencana Capital. Mokhzani, who exited Yinson but now wholly owns Kencana Capital, tells The Edge that the deal represents a buyout of Yeow\u2019s interests in the private vehicle. Yinson\u2019s share price has increased more than 8% over the past year. It closed at RM3.17 last Monday, above the RM3.07 Yeow paid for the block. Computer Forms (M) Bhd also saw sizeable trades. On Oct 14, a 14.36% block or 5.88 million shares changed hands in a direct deal worth RM6.77 million or RM1.15 per share. The stake matches the number of shares held by the company\u2019s largest shareholder, World Grain Sdn Bhd, based on its latest annual report. However, there were no filings on the substantial shareholder change at the time of writing. Last Monday, Computer Forms saw a total of 3.93 million shares traded in several direct deals at RM1.18 each or RM4.64 million in total. As at last Tuesday, the counter had fallen by more than 18% year to date. Over at Mintye Industries Bhd, majority shareholder Yatee & Sons Sdn Bhd increased its stake on Oct 14, acquiring five million shares or 8.22% equity interest for RM5 million from Alidin Sdn Bhd. The latter is Mintye Industries\u2019 second largest shareholder. After the transaction, Yatee & Sons\u2019 shareholding increased to 59.17%. The company is the vehicle of brothers Yeo Kim Swee and Yeo Kim Soon \u2014 who are Mintye Industries\u2019 executive chairman and managing director respectively \u2014 and their families. The brothers are, in turn, sons of Yeo Ah Tee, the listed company\u2019s founder who retired as executive chairman in July last year. Alidin is controlled by Mazlan Mohamad and Sari Idris, who are board members at Mintye Industries. The company was suspended from trading from Oct 17 for a share exchange scheme, which will see its shareholders get one share in Mintye Bhd for every share held in Mintye Industries as part of a listing transfer exercise. Elsewhere, Parkson Holdings Bhd saw a 5.18% block change hands for RM42 million on Oct 14. That represents a price of 75 sen a share, lower than its last transacted price of 78 sen on that day. The stock has fallen 23% over the past 12 months. BIMB Holdings Bhd saw 36.57 million shares or a 2.2% stake change hands in multiple direct transactions between Oct 14 and Oct 17.

On Sept 29, there was a direct deal of 22 million shares at 8.5 sen apiece, which was the stock\u2019s closing price on that day and its one-year low. This values the stake at RM1.87 million.

On Sept 30, Aluminium Co of Malaysia Bhd (Alcom) saw 78.23 million shares change hands at 61 sen apiece or RM47.72 million in total. At that price, the direct deal took place at a 37.1% discount to the 97 sen apiece the shares fetched on the open market that day.

While this is 4% off its recent high of RM2.26 on Sept 26, it is 80.8% above its 52-week low of RM1.20 on Sept 30 last year. There is still upside potential, underpinned by its sizeable construction order book, which stood at RM1.93 billion as at June 30 this year. That is enough to \u201ckeep the company busy for the next three years\u201d, RHB Research Institute says in a Sept 22 note. RHB is one of the six analysts with a \u201cbuy\u201d call on the engineering and construction service provider, which specialises in industrial building systems (which are booming in Malaysia and Singapore) and precast concrete products. Excluding Maybank Kim Eng Research\u2019s RM1.70 target price, which has been exceeded, target prices range from RHB\u2019s RM2.39 to DBS Vickers Research\u2019s RM2.87, Bloomberg data shows. That implies 10.1% to 32.3% upside potential. Those who agree with this bullish projection might consider its warrant, Kimlun-WA, which fetched a 16.6% premium to the underlying stock as it closed at 85 sen last Wednesday. Kimlun-WA has a RM1.68 strike price, one-to-one conversion ratio and over seven years to run before expiring on March 12, 2024. Kimlun-WA has had a good run the past year. At its recent high of 88 sen last Tuesday, the warrant is up 144% or 2.4 times from 36 sen on Oct 2 last year. If Kimlun rises 32.3% to the highest RM2.87 target price, Kimlun-WA should theoretically be worth 40% more or RM1.19, assuming zero premium to the underlying shares. The upside is higher should the warrant continue to fetch a premium to the mother share. Kenanga Research, which has a RM2.44 fair value for Kimlun, says it is \u201ca good proxy for the booming local construction sector, given its involvement in MRT2 (supply of precast concrete segments), Pan Borneo Highway and the construction of affordable housing\u201d. Kimlun\u2019s earnings profile \u201chas improved tremendously over the last 12 months\u201d, Kenanga writes in a Sept 22 note, adding that the construction unit no longer relies on residential jobs but has expanded to the construction of hospitals (Gleneagles Medini), a shopping mall (IGB\u2019s Southkey Megamall) and hostels (Sime Darby\u2019s Pagoh Education Hub) as well as infrastructure (a section of the Pan Borneo Highway via a 30%-owned venture with Zecon). Its manufacturing unit has widened its product offering to include rail sleepers (for the Thomson Line in Singapore) and parapet walls.

Since listing on the Main Board of Bursa Malaysia in June 2003, the group\u2019s earnings growth has been erratic \u2014 spiking every two to three years when it clinches a project. Its maiden development, 3 Two Square in Section 19, Petaling Jaya, was launched in 2007 and helped boost earnings in the financial years ended Dec 31, 2007 and 2008. Earnings slid in the following years before picking up again in FY2011 and FY2012, thanks to its Batu Tiga development in Shah Alam. \u201cMoving forward, we will stagger our projects to have earnings growing at a steady pace and we target to have one mega [property] project a year,\u201d Yong tells The Edge in an interview. Crest Builder\u2019s net profit halved to RM10.41 million last year from RM20.76 million in FY2014. However, revenue rose 37% to RM283.94 million. Yong expects the group\u2019s net profit and revenue to be slightly better this financial year. \u201cThere will be no fireworks in this year\u2019s earnings, but we expect them to be slightly better than last year\u2019s, with contribution from the last phase of the RM390 million Residensi Hijauan project in Batu Tiga and the balance of sales from the RM328 million Alam Sanjung project in Shah Alam. \u201cAs for contribution from the construction sector, it will come from the RM438.3 million mixed development contract clinched from Sime Darby Melawati Development Sdn Bhd in June and the RM198 million Anggun serviced apartments contract in Jalan Sultan Ismail, Kuala Lumpur, which was secured from UDA Holdings Bhd last year,\u201d he says. For 1HFY2016, it posted a 28.6% decline in net profit to RM5.99 million from a year ago, while revenue fell 10.7% to RM105.96 million. Yong says Crest Builder will see some exciting times next year when its first mega property project, [email\u00a0protected] Ampang in Kuala Lumpur, which has a gross development value of RM1.1 billion, will be launched in the second quarter. \u201cThe construction of the 42-storey mixed-use development has already started. The project has three components, namely residential, retail and office. For the residential component, we are pricing the units at between RM1,350 and RM1,650 psf,\u201d he says. Located above the Dang Wangi light rail transit (LRT) station, [email\u00a0protected] Ampang is a joint venture (JV) with Prasarana Malaysia Bhd. \u201c[To maintain steady earnings growth] for FY2018 onwards, we are trying to secure one or two more privatisation projects within the next six months. Their values are sizeable,\u201d says Yong, but declines to elaborate. Crest Builder has won another JV project with Prasarana to develop vacant land around the Kelana Jaya LRT station. Yong says the project is expected to commence in late 2018 or 2019. \u201cWe are also looking at developing other parcels belonging to Prasarana, which are along rail lines. We are waiting for the next few tenders to be called. They seem satisfied with our performance so far, as we have been assisting them in all the authority clearances [in relation to [email\u00a0protected] Ampang and the upcoming Kelana Jaya project],\u201d he says. \u201cWe have been doing a lot of property projects on our own. We hope to do more JVs with government-linked companies, going forward. The advantage of such JVs is that they ease our cash flow in terms of payment for the land and require smaller capital outlays. The downside of JVs is that approvals take a long time as they involve many tiers.\u201d On its JV with the Malaysian Rubber Board to develop a RM1.33 billion mixed-use development in Jalan Ampang, Yong says the development order has been submitted. \u201cWe are targeting to commence construction in the second half of 2018.\u201d Crest Builder has transformed itself from a pure construction player to a contractor-cum-developer. For FY2016, it expects the profit contribution from its property business to be 60%, with the construction segment contributing the remaining 40%. An ideal ratio is 70% from property and 30% from construction, says Yong. \u201cI don\u2019t intend to go fully into property development because our bread and butter is still construction. We want to be boutique-based, meaning I will do anything apart from townships. Townships are not our forte and the capital outlay is also very heavy. We prefer to go for mature neighbourhoods with a faster turnaround time like seven to eight years,\u201d he explains. The group is looking at a steady replenishment of its construction order book of between RM500 million and RM600 million a year. \u201cCurrently, our gross order book stands at RM1.28 billion, of which RM1.1 billion is unbuilt,\u201d he says. Meanwhile, Crest Builder continues to seek buyers for its two assets in Petaling Jaya, which are valued at RM280 million. One of them is The Crest \u2014 a 16-storey commercial building at\u00a0 3 Two Square where the group\u2019s headquarters are located \u2014 which could fetch as much as RM130 million. The other is Tierra Crest, a 17-storey commercial building in Kelana Jaya valued at about RM150 million. \u201cAs a construction company, I find that owning these two properties puts heavy stress on our cash flow [to service the loans] and I am sitting on two pots of cash. As such, we have been looking at monetising the two assets to free up capital,\u201d says Yong. Crest Builder\u2019s cash flow is a major concern for most investors. The cash and cash equivalents of the group stood at RM112.22 million as at June 30, 2016, while its short and long-term borrowings amounted to RM669.01 million. Yong explains that the bulk of the borrowings consists of long-term loans secured against The Crest and Tierra Crest and a RM510 million sukuk issued to finance its Universiti Teknologi Mara \u00a0campus project in Tapah, Perak. \u201cStripping out these borrowings, our gearing is at a comfortable level of below 0.4 times.\u201d Yong notes that at present, there is no plan for the group to go to the capital market to raise funds as he thinks that Crest Builder\u2019s securities are trading below par. \u201cWe would rather wait for the market to pick up first,\u201d he adds. Last November, in view of the market conditions, the group aborted plans for a proposed placement of up to 10% of its issued share capital to raise RM29.8 million.\u00a0 Yong, formerly the executive director of the group, is the second generation at the group\u2019s helm. He assumed the leadership role on Sept 3 last year and, at 33 years old, is one of the youngest managing directors of a publicly traded company in the country. His father, the late Yong Soon Chow, 63, was the group managing director and founder. Yong now shares the responsibility of running the group with his three sisters and mother. His mother, Koh Hua Lan, and his sister, Yong Tiok Keng, are executive directors of the group. The Yong family currently own 38.18% of Crest Builder via their private vehicle SC Yong Holdings Sdn Bhd. Yong says his family have no intention of paring their stake in Crest Builder and want to raise it as they think the stock is undervalued.

We slightly lower our net earnings per share (EPS) forecasts and TP after incorporating the end-FY16 issued share capital of 6.33 billion shares. A proposed PP through a book-building process and a maximum discount of 5% to the volume-weighted average price is to repay borrowings, fund capital expenditure and strengthen the group\u2019s shareholder funds.

The potential EPS dilution can be offset by a higher crude palm oil average selling price (unless negated by lower production), or contributions from the other core divisions.

He told me I could do whatever I wanted with it but also remember that if I abused it, I would limit my own credibility and he would never give me this kind of money again,\u201d says Beh. \u201cA lot of my friends were from billionaire families, but their parents really limited their allowances to see how they would survive. My father was from another school of thought. He thought that if you want to see how crazy a guy can be, give him money and power.\u201d Beh acquitted himself admirably. He did not run out of money and he did not make the headlines for doing all the wrong things. He worked hard academically and played polo. In fact, he was the captain of the England under-21 team. He even managed to go the University of Virginia in the US as a \u201cpolo scholar\u201d.\u00a0 He completed a four-year double major (in economics and Asian studies) in three years and went to work at one of the oldest investment banks on Wall Street \u2014 Dominick & Dominick. This was just before the crash and Wall Street was still floating on a tide of irrational exuberance. \u201cAt the time, a lot of Chinese companies were going public. We did plenty of reverse mergers. Later, I joined another investment bank called Maxim, which did 99% of all the special purpose acquisition corporations (SPACs) in the US,\u201d he says. Beh was fascinated by what investment bankers did and how they did it. \u201cThey know what deals are out there and who has the money to invest in them. They were the connectors. But when they got too greedy, when they started selling snake oil, when they didn\u2019t even know what they were selling, that was when things went wrong.\u201d He was there towards the end of the Wolf of Wall Street days. \u201cYeah, I would say the movie was true. I have seen when they close deals, they party hard, buy bottles, buy models. It is all real, it is not made up.\u201d\u00a0 He was also there when it all went pear-shaped. \u201cI had roommates who worked at Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns and they told me that a few of the partners literally had heart attacks when they were filing Chapter 11 [bankruptcy]. They had lost their entire net worth because everything was tied to the stocks.\u201d Although there was a bloodbath on Wall Street, Beh remained relatively unaffected. \u201cI still had my job at the end of it, but the deal flow had dried up. After a few months of doing nothing much, I became restless. I still got paid, but what was the point? So I said, \u2018I have seen enough and it is time to go home,\u2019\u201d he recalls. Did he miss the perks when he came home? No, he says. It was nice while it lasted, but not necessary. \u201cI take commercial flights and I can take budget airlines; no big deal \u2014 whatever gets you from point A to B. When someone else is paying versus you paying out of your own pocket, there is a difference,\u201d says Beh. Naturally, not everyone took the transition lightly. \u201cIt is the difference between viewing the perks as a tasting menu, where you taste and enjoy them, or as a drug, where you need this and without it, you are dead,\u201d he says. Why didn\u2019t he lose his head? It was because he had seen it all, even at that young age, having rubbed shoulders with the glitterati of the world because of polo. \u201cI met the Sultan of Brunei when I was 14. And I have played against Prince William and Prince Harry.\u00a0 \u201cPolo, as Winston Churchill says, is like a passport to diplomacy. You get to meet heads of state, top lawyers and bankers and other celebrities.\u201d Sports did give Beh a good platform but it was what he did with it that mattered. \u201cI think there are a lot of fortunate kids out there who have the platform. The problem with them is they have everything and no drive to do anything.\u201d When he returned, the lifestyle adjustment was no problem. The job adjustment was another thing altogether. \u201cWall Street was a great experience because we were at the centre of things. When I joined my family business, I found it unsexy. It was boring, archaic, even ancient. But somewhere down the road, I realised that in this industry, you could touch lives in a positive manner,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople would come and thank me because they had early detection and so were able to treat their cancer. I felt that by doing this, I was building the karma money; future points.\u201d But it was not enough. Although as the eldest son, his position in his father\u2019s company was assured, he did not want to be perceived as someone who made it because of who his father was. Beh worked hard to build the company when he took over as managing director, increasing the number of branches from 50 to more than 200 in six years and growing the workforce from a few hundred to a few thousand. But he was not satisfied.\u00a0 \u201cOne day, a friend of mine, Joel Neoh, approached me. He is the partner and ex-CEO of Groupon Asia-Pacific. We knew each other because we were Ernst & Young Entrepreneurs of the Year in the emerging category for different years,\u201d he says. \u201cHe told me what I was doing with my family business was very interesting, but why didn\u2019t I want to grow faster? I said, \u2018How much faster can I grow?\u2019 Anyone can tell you that BP Healthcare has grown so fast in a short period of time.\u201d\u00a0 But Neoh had a plan. \u201cHe asked me why I didn\u2019t use technology and invited me to come on board BookDoc as a co-founder. He would help on the technology side because his expertise was to scale and would leave the industry know-how to me.\u201d BookDoc allows users to search and make appointments with healthcare professionals, such as doctors, specialists, dentists and physiotherapists. In just seven months, he managed to sign up some major players. \u201cI got Socso to be my partner for the next five years. I got Agoda, a US$66 billion company, which is the largest aggregator of hotels online to come on board. This was its first ever tie-up with a start-up.\u201d\u00a0 Beh works very hard. \u201cI used to travel for work and for polo, but never like this. I have never travelled so much in my life. I am up at 5am to take the earliest flight to Singapore, arrive there at 8.30am, have a meeting there and take the red-eye home so I am back by midnight. And the next day, I am on a flight to Hong Kong. I have been travelling like that every week,\u201d he says. He is 31 now and he admits that he does get tired. \u201cBut when I think of what I have managed to achieve, it is a thrill that money cannot buy. No start-up has grown at this rate; it is unprecedented.\u201d Although his previous networks have opened doors, it is how he uses them that matters. \u201cI keep knocking on doors. My greatest strength is persistence. I keep going until I get it done.\u201d He has already signed up an impressive list of partners, but he is nowhere near done. \u201cI want to look for other partners. The largest accommodation aggregator is Airbnb. I got connected with the founder and boom! I think we are going to work with them as well.\u201d The list of investors reads like a who\u2019s who. \u201cWhen I first started, there was Joel. Then, I got the Ministry of Health\u2019s director-general Datuk Dr Maimunah Hamid, former chairman of the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission Datuk Sharil Tarmizi, former Hong Leong Bank CEO Datuk Yvonne Cheah, and the head of corporate finance at Sime Darby Healthcare. The last investor we got was from the Brunei royal family.\u201d How did he manage to do this? \u201cIt is just my track record working. Some of them, I didn\u2019t even ask. They came up to me and said, \u2018Hey, I heard you are doing this. You are my friend. How come you never asked me?\u2019\u201d \u00a0 Investment approach Beh\u2019s approach to investment reflects his age and consequently, high-risk appetite. \u201cAt this stage, I am a young guy and I can take a lot of risks. You can see this from the fact that most of my time, effort and money are being spent on a start-up right now. If I make it, it will be a big home run and if I don\u2019t, well, it is what it is,\u201d he shrugs with an attempt at nonchalance. As for stocks, he is both an investor and a punter. \u201cDuring the financial crisis, I bought the stocks of all the financial firms. Today, I am like a 100% up on nearly all of the stocks. I bought GE, ING, Bear Stearns \u2014 which went belly up \u2014 and Citibank. Overall, I made money. Some are just trades. I play on the thing called a mean reversion,\u201d he says. Mean reversion refers to buying when bad news causes a stock to tank. Beh believes that in most cases, the stock will move back up again. And for the most part, he has been proved right.\u00a0 For instance, Beh says he bought a stock called Sirus at 70 US cents and it is now trading at US$5. \u201cWith mean reversion, you invest in strategy, not play on the fundamentals.\u201d He has made some traditional investments such as property. \u201cI own properties in Malaysia and abroad. I am quite fortunate. I bought a nice apartment in New York back when the exchange rate was RM3 to US$1. So, I already made on that, plus I get rental income.\u00a0 \u201cI always believe that in places like New York, property prices will be a steady state or going up, but never coming down because of the scarcity of properties and the regulations about tearing down buildings to build new ones.\u201d His philosophy in life is simple. \u201cI think everyone has a purpose whether they are rich or poor. People are created for a reason and you have to determine how far you want to go, how much you want to contribute and how much you want to earn.\u201d\u00a0"}, "134": {"date_posted": "23/8/2016", "title": "KLCI falls 8pts on Sime Darby, profit taking", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 23): The FBM KLCI fell eight points or 0.5% on Sime Darby Bhd share losses and as investors took profit after the index's recent gains.

As at 3:16 p.m., Sime Darby was the seventh top gainer on Bursa Securities, after it gained 17 sen or 2.1% to trade at RM8.26, with 7.51 million shares done. It had earlier touched RM8.27. Yesterday, Sime Darby announced the RTO of Saizen REIT, under which it will be injecting several of its industrial properties in Australia into the REIT, in exchange for a a certain amount of units in the REIT and cash. The conglomerate, via its indirect wholly-owned unit Sime Darby Property Singapore Ltd (Sime Darby Prop Singapore), will also be taking up an 80% stake in Japan Residential Assets Manager Ltd (JRAM), the manager of Saizen REIT. The injection of the properties and the JRAM acquisition are inter-conditional. Sime Darby said the move was in line with its corporate strategy to develop a REIT platform, in order to generate a resilient and recurring income stream. \u201cMoving forward, this REIT platform is expected to have greater flexibility in its future fund-raising exercises to build a sizeable international portfolio of assets, which Sime Darby will benefit from its direct stake in Saizen REIT,\u201d it said. \u201cIn addition, the proposals would enable Sime Darby to monetise the properties on which HDAL will continue its operations under the master lease, while de-leveraging its balance sheet,\u201d it added. Following the signing of a framework agreement on the asset injection, Sime Darby said negotiations will begin for parties to mutually agree on the terms of the definitive transaction agreements to be entered into between the parties by Sept 30, 2016. The price tag of the assets shall be negotiated and will be based on independent valuations of the properties, Sime Darby added. As for the JRAM acquisition consideration, it shall be the aggregate of 80% of the net assets of JRAM, plus US$1 million (to RM4.01 million), and on the basis that the net assets will be no less than S$1 million (RM2.98 million) and no more than S$1.10 million (RM3.28 million).

Despite declining earnings in the past two years, most companies listed on Bursa Malaysia have been able to maintain their dividend payouts at above 3%. However, some pertinent questions come to mind, especially for income investors: Can the companies maintain dividends amid a slowing economy? What sectors and companies are reducing dividends? And more importantly, are there any sectors or companies that are paying better dividends? By compiling data from cash flow statements, Chart 1 shows the dividends paid to shareholders in the past five years and the first quarter of 2016. While companies may pay dividends in the next quarter after they have declared the quantum, most of them pay out at a predictable frequency and time every year, making such cash flow data comparable on a year-on-year basis. That said, it should be noted that the dividend data from cash flow statements is lagging by a quarter and it disregards the sources of the funds, that is, the dividends could come from non-operating activities. For instance, companies could sell their assets and pay dividends with the proceeds. As shown in Chart 1, dividends paid by Bursa-listed companies dropped 6.3% to RM11.6 billion from a year ago, albeit by a lesser extent compared with an 18.4% fall in aggregate 1Q2016 corporate earnings. Sectors that paid lower dividends in the first quarter \u2014 a RM2.3 billion reduction \u2014 include plantation, telecommunications, oil and gas and automotive (see Chart 2). \u00a0 Dividend cut by heavyweight sectors The plantation sector accounted for 28.7% of the RM2.3 billion reduction in dividends, followed by conglomerate (26%), telecommunications (17.3%), oil and gas equipment and services (5.8%) and automotive (3.8%). Together, the five sectors (based on Bloomberg classification) accounted for 82% of the amount. At the company level, conglomerate Sime Darby Bhd saw the biggest reduction in dividend payout \u2014 RM639 million \u2014 in the first quarter due to lower earnings from its plantation, industrial and motor segments (see Table 1). Note that the plantation segment was the group\u2019s largest earnings contributor, accounting for a quarter of its revenue and a third of its operating income in FY2015. Other plantation companies that cut dividend sharply include Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd (KLK) and IOI Corp Bhd, which were affected by weak crude palm oil prices last year. While KLK saw its FY2015 earnings fall 12.3% to RM869.9 million from a year ago, IOI Corp\u2019s earnings plunged 95% to\u00a0 RM168.1 million from FY2014, mainly due to its large US dollar debt exposure. As for Kulim Malaysia Bhd, the company paid a special dividend of RM500 million in 1Q2015 instead of an interim dividend like in 2014. This came about after it disposed of New Britain Palm Oil Ltd to Sime Darby. Having completed its capital reduction and repayment exercise on July 5, Kulim is in the process of being taken private by controlling shareholder Johor Corp. Over at DiGi.Com Bhd, the dividend cut reflects its lower profitability due to intensifying competition and the fact that it has been paying out close to 100% of its profits in the past three years. As Maxis Bhd has so far maintained its profitability relatively well, the dividend cut last year was because it lowered its dividend payout ratio to below 100% and stopped borrowing to pay dividends. Shares of Maxis and DiGi have been recovering since May, partly due to decent yields \u2014 3.3% for Maxis and 4.3% for DiGi. Nonetheless, with competitive pressures limiting growth opportunities (for example, Telekom Malaysia Bhd\u2019s (TM) new 4G LTE mobile service webe) and the upcoming spectrum reallocation exercise, dividend upside for this sector seems limited and there is a possibility of further dividend cuts due to either spectrum fees or lower profitability. \u00a0 Higher dividends by GLCs Sectors that paid higher dividends contributed RM1.5 billion more in the first quarter, mostly led by individual companies (see Chart 3 and Table 2). TM, MISC Bhd, Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd, Petronas Gas Bhd \u2014 government-linked companies (GLCs) with a dominant industry position or strong parentage backing \u2014 accounted for over 60% of the amount. However, at a closer look, things are not exactly rosy. For TM, the RM455 million paid out in 1Q2016 was due to a change in the timing of dividend payments. The integrated\u00a0 telecoms service provider, which is 28.6%-owned by Khazanah Nasional Bhd, changed the dividend type of its second payout for FY2015 from final to second interim dividend, accelerating its dividend payment by two to three months to 1Q2016. MISC, which is 62.7%-owned by Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas), raised its dividend payout ratio from 10.7% in 2013 to 54.3% last year. The shipping company paid out\u00a0 RM401.7 million in 2014 and 50% more last year, although earnings grew only 12% in the same period. In 1H2016, dividends rose to\u00a0 RM1 billion, 66.7% higher than that of last year. The higher dividends could be attributed to the disposal of its international tank terminal business, VTTI BV, for RM3.4 billion in 4Q2015 as part of its initiative to hive off uncompetitive non-core businesses. MISC is currently divesting its logistics arm, MISC Integrated Logistics Sdn Bhd, which is expected to bring about RM358 million in total proceeds. The stock took a dive in late April from RM8.90 to a one-year low of RM7.25 on May 9, following consensus earnings cut due to the weaker outlook for petroleum and liquefied natural gas shipping rates. Data compiled by Bloomberg shows that the street expects MISC\u2019s operating profit to decline 21% this year, with a lower yield of 2.9%. Another Petronas subsidiary that paid higher dividends is Petronas Chemicals. It paid 25% or RM160 million more in the first quarter. As the petrochemical company has been paying out about 50% of its profits, the bigger payout was because of improved profitability last year. Despite a 7.3% drop in revenue due to lower crude oil prices, net profit rose 12.9% year on year to RM2.8 billion, thanks to a higher plant utilisation rate of 85% and weaker ringgit. Supported by its strong cash flow generation, Petronas Chemicals is expanding its capacity over the next few years through the Sabah ammonia urea project and the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development Project in Johor. Taking the multi-year capacity expansion plan into account, analysts are forecasting 10.2% earnings growth for the company next year. Other non-GLCs that paid higher dividends in 1Q2016 include property investment company Selangor Properties Bhd, brewer Heineken Malaysia Bhd, Hong Leong Bank Bhd and hard disk drive component maker JCY International Bhd. Both Selangor Properties and JCY incurred a loss in the latest quarter, largely due to foreign exchange losses on overseas investments and receivables/hedging instruments. Mounting dividend risk with declining profits While companies could liquidate assets or borrow to pay dividends, the ability to sustain and grow dividends is still driven by profitability. As shown in Chart 4, corporate profits in the past five quarters have been particularly impacted by rising operating costs as well as ringgit volatility, which led to foreign exchange losses and higher import costs. Despite the declining earnings from 1Q2015 to 4Q2015, listed companies have been paying a similar level of dividends throughout the year, resulting in a jump in dividend payout ratio from 53% in 1Q2015 to 72% in 4Q2015. As this practice is not sustainable, 1Q2016 saw a reduction in dividends. Nevertheless, as some companies may not pay dividends in the first quarter, the 1Q2016 dividend data may not be complete and sufficient enough to identify sectors or firms that have been growing their dividends. Hence, we have also compiled a list of the top 50 companies that have paid higher dividends (in absolute value) in the past five years (see Table 3 on Page 68). Many of these dividend growers have unique competitive strengths to capture the growth of their respective industry. That said, past performance is by no means indicative of future results and certain companies like DiGi and Sime Darby have reduced their dividends due to new industry developments. As dividends include proceeds from asset disposals, an increased payout could indicate a business restructuring or change in business model and, thus, may warrant a closer look. For example, both MISC and RCE Capital Bhd paid out much higher dividends last year as a result of initiatives to focus on their core business or to achieve a more efficient capital structure.\u00a0"}, "137": {"date_posted": "25/7/2016", "title": "Sime Darby range bound , says AllianceDBS Research", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (July 25): AllianceDBS Research said Sime Darby Bhd (Sime) was trading range bound and that Sime had on July 22 tested previous day\u2019s high of RM7.65 before settling at the day\u2019s high of RM7.65 (up 5 sen or 0.65%).

In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, CIMB Group said CIMB Thai's net profit in the second quarter ended June 2016 (2QFY16) fell from 217.56 million baht a year earlier. CIMB Thai's income statement showed that operating expenses rose to 1.73 billion baht while bad debt and impairment losses climbed to 1.38 billion baht.

Gromutual added that the disposal is expected to be completed in the last quarter of 2016 and has no significant effect on the group's earnings for the financial year ended December 2016. Pantech Group Holdings Bhd's net profit fell 11.34% to RM8.1 million in its first quarter ended May 2016 from RM9.1 million a year ago, on lower contribution from its manufacturing division that was affected by lower global demand from the oil and gas sector. Competitive pricing was also a contributing factor to the weaker manufacturing performance, Pantech told Bursa Malaysia in a filing today. Revenue fell in tandem by 10.6% to RM123.9 million from RM138.6 million in the previous corresponding quarter. The steel products maker declared a first interim single tier dividend of 0.5 sen for the financial year ending February 2017, which will be paid on Oct 19. Scomi Engineering Bhd is seeking an arbitration to resolve its dispute with Prasarana Malaysia Bhd over the latter's decision to terminate Scomi in the KL Monorail extension project due to an alleged delay in train delivery. In a bourse filing today, Scomi Engineering said its wholly-owned unit Scomi Transit Projects Sdn Bhd has issued a notice of arbitration to Prasarana today. The dispute, it said, arose in relation to a notice of termination dated June 9, 2016 that was issued by Prasarana, which gave Scomi 14 days from the date of notice to renew a performance bond connected with the project, failing which the project's contract, dated June 3, 2011, would be terminated.

We maintain our \u201chold\u201d rating on the stock, with a slightly higher price-earnings ratio-based 12-month TP of RM7.16, from RM7.11. A key upside risk is stronger-than-expected crude palm oil (CPO) prices. Key downside risks include a deterioration in the global economic outlook and weaker-than-expected CPO prices. \u2014 Affin Hwang Research, July 15"}, "140": {"date_posted": "13/7/2016", "title": "Trade Wise: Brexit: Gauging the contagion effect of Brexit", "article": " This article first appeared in Corporate, The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on June 27 - July 3, 2016. WHILE most analysts agree that Malaysia\u2019s fundamentals will not be significantly affected by Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit), many fear the spillover effects and inevitable uncertainties could weigh on the local economy and financial markets. Nomura Securities warned clients not to underestimate the \u201cdepth and reach of financial market contagion to Asia\u201d. In its note last Friday, it says that taking the view that the financial and economic impact would only be limited to the UK due to its economic size is too simplistic for two reasons. \u201cFirst, we expect non-trivial spillover to the Euro area\u2019s economy and financial markets. While the value of merchandise exports from the rest of the EU to the UK is only 3% of the rest of the EU\u2019s GDP, the UK\u2019s position as a global financial hub \u2014 the UK financial sector\u2019s assets account for more than eight times its GDP \u2014 leaves the rest of the EU much more exposed to the UK in terms of financial and investment linkages, in part reflecting the UK\u2019s relatively liberalised domestic market and its strong legal framework and institutions,\u201d Nomura says. Secondly, it fears that Brexit could further inflame anti-EU sentiment in other member states, increasing fears that they would also leave the union. Asian equities and currencies tumbled last Friday after 51.9% of the UK electorate voted to leave the EU the day before. The FBM KLCI declined 1.7% to 1,611 before recovering to 1,634. Save for the South Korean won, the ringgit was the hardest-hit among the major Asian currencies, sliding 2.1% against the US dollar to 4.09. \u201cWe believe that the overall implications of the vote to leave are negative for emerging currencies, particularly the central and eastern European currencies. In addition to this, currencies with large foreign portfolio exposure and wide external imbalances will also face large downside pressure. These currencies are also the most \u2018risk off\u2019 currencies and include the Indonesian rupiah, Malaysian ringgit, Turkish lira and Brazilian real,\u201d writes HSBC Global Research in a recent report. Nonetheless, the biggest victims of Brexit appear to be the British pound and the UK and European markets. The pound took a pounding, depreciating 8% against the greenback while the Euro Stoxx and FTSE lost 8.4% and 3.5% of their market value respectively in the first few hours of trading last Friday. In contrast, US Treasuries, the yen, the Swiss franc and gold rose as investors flocked to safe-haven assets amid heightened market volatility. Local brokers generally think that Brexit will have a minimal impact on Malaysia. Hong Leong Investment Bank in a June 24 report points out that Malaysia\u2019s trade with the UK amounted to only 1% of total exports while foreign direct investment from the UK in the 2008 to 2015 period averaged just 4% annually. Hence, risk to Malaysia emanates mainly from financial contagion. Credit Suisse in a recent note says only a handful of Malaysian companies have significant exposure to the UK. Indeed, only five companies in the FBM KLCI lost more than 2% of their market capitalisation last Friday. Out of the five, Genting Bhd, Genting Malaysia Bhd and YTL Corp Bhd saw their shares decline 2.4% to 3.8%. The other two large caps are SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd and Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd, which lost 4.3% and 3.8% of their market value respectively last Friday. \u201cThe increased market volatility we see today is due to the risk off sentiment, which dominates market sentiment following the Brexit vote. As investors reverse their positions in risky assets and emerging markets, local bonds and equities and the ringgit will certainly be under selling pressure. Meanwhile, we also saw the US and European stock index futures drop a few percentages, indicating that US and European shares are likely to fall when the markets open later,\u201d says Areca Capital CEO Danny Wong. \u201cThat said, the selldown is just a knee-jerk reaction and is short term in nature. Brexit would still require parliamentary approval and it could take up to two years to complete the process. Positively, the odds of having two rate hikes this year are very low as the US Fed turns more cautious on the outlook of the global economies. This is good news for emerging market equities,\u201d he adds. \u201cAfter the dust settles, investors will reassess the market situation and probably come back the Asia \u2014 the only bright spot that offers decent growth in a low interest rate environment. The alternatives don\u2019t look attractive enough: US interest rates are too low while investors have largely turned more cautious towards European assets. Therefore, the next couple of days could be a good time to capitalise on the Brexit-induced share price weakness and accumulate blue-chip stocks such as Tenaga Nasional Bhd or Malayan Banking Bhd,\u201d Wong concludes. \u201cThe market turmoil is a natural flight to safety but it\u2019s still too early to gauge the full impact. I think we have to wait and see how the US markets respond to Brexit and how the Asian markets respond to US shares on Monday. So far, our local stock market has held up relatively well against its Asian peers with the FBM KLCI still staying above 1,600. For instance, Tokyo Stock Price Index lost 8% and Hang Seng dropped 3% while FBM KLCI fell marginally by 0.4%. Malaysian Government Securities saw yields rise but the amount was small,\u201d says Etiqa Insurance & Takaful head of research Chris Eng. \u201cStrategy-wise, watch the FBM KLCI on Monday \u2014 after the US markets absorb the Brexit news \u2014 on whether it can remain resilient and stay above 1,600. As the initial system shock from Brexit subsides, and as the markets expect just one Fed rate hike in 2016, I believe that the local stock market could gradually recover towards 4Q. As such, if the index trades close to 1,600, it\u2019s a pretty good entry point to accumulate stocks. However, if the index falls below 1,600, this will also set off another leg for a further fall,\u201d he adds. \u201cNonetheless, Brexit is still a negative development for the global trade and economy. Looking ahead, the further disintegration in the EU and the rise of populist politics are risks that investors need to watch out for. People shrugged off the possibility of Rodrigo Duterte becoming the president of the Philippines, but it happened. Then people thought that Brexit was unlikely to materialise, but it happened. This November, we have the US presidential election and people dismiss the idea that populist candidate Donald Trump could be elected into office. If Trump really becomes president of the US, this could have an adverse impact on global trades, economies and markets,\u201d Eng concludes. \u00a0 Impact on sectors Analysts do not expect Brexit to directly impact Malaysian banks as their exposure to the UK is very small. The UK-related loans of the largest bank, Malayan Banking Bhd, amounted to RM1.27 billion as at end-March, or just 0.3% of total loans. CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, the second largest bank, had UK-related loans amounting to RM948 million, also just 0.3% of total loans. \u201cLoans to the UK is really small, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be a direct impact. But there could be secondary effects, in that the banks may have exposure to companies that have high exposure to the UK,\u201d says a banking analyst with a local research brokerage. In a June 21 report, Credit Suisse notes a stronger British pound means higher ringgit revenue and profits (or vice versa), translated from the UK business units. YTL Power International Bhd leads the pack as some 24% of its revenue is derived from UK-based Wessex Water. The water and sewerage subsidiary in the UK contributes ~82% of YTL Power\u2019s pre-tax earnings. This business will likely remain resilient after Brexit. With over 40 casinos, Genting Malaysia is one of the largest casino operators in the UK. Credit Suisse estimates that Genting Malaysia\u2019s UK operations will only contribute 2.5% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation in 2016E. Genting is exposed to UK via its 49.3% stake in Genting Malaysia. The Battersea Power Station project in the UK is owned by Sime Darby Bhd and S P Setia Bhd (40% each), with the Employees Provident Fund owning the remainder. A weaker economy will adversely affect the take-up in future property launches in the country. Sime Darby\u2019s property division will see associate profit contribution from Battersea in the UK in FY2017. \u201cWe estimate that Battersea will make up about 11% of Sime\u2019s net profit. If the UK economy weakens, the worry is that future launches in Battersea will be adversely impacted. The Malaysian property market remains lacklustre,\u201d says Credit Suisse. The first phase is expected to be handed over progressively over a six-month period from December 2016 and the expected contribution to S P Setia\u2019s bottom line is about RM280 million, or 36% of consensus\u2019 FY2017 estimates, it says. Eco World Development Group Bhd and Eastern & Oriental Bhd have meaningful exposure to the UK as well. Eco World International (EWI), in which the listed Eco World will eventually hold a 30% stake upon its listing, has a huge exposure in the UK. As at January, EWI recorded \u00a3712 million in property sales. E&O ventured to the UK in 2012 when it acquired Princes House in Central London. The project with an estimated gross development value of \u00a360 million is slated for completion this year, in which revenue and profit will then be recognised. E&O recently aborted its proposal to list its UK-based property unit, E&O Plc, on the London Stock Exchange. Although the local bourse\u2019s decline last Friday was the smallest among the region\u2019s markets, the uncertainty over the global effects of Brexit is likely to dampen investor sentiment in the coming weeks, until the dust settles and clarity emerges.\u00a0"}, "141": {"date_posted": "27/6/2016", "title": "Sime Darby\u2019s divestment has minimal impact", "article": " This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on June 27, 2016. \u00a0 Sime Darby Bhd\n(June 24, RM7.49)\nMaintain neutral with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM7.85.

Earnings impact is also minimal as we expect Hotel Equatorial Melaka\u2019s earnings contribution to be immaterial given the challenging outlook in the hotel industry. We expect the news to have minimal impact on Sime Darby\u2019s share price. Excluding the news, weak earnings from industrial division should keep Sime Darby\u2019s share price upside limited.

Berjaya Credit Sdn Bhd (BCredit), an indirect wholly-owned unit of Berjaya Retail Bhd (BRetail), which is controlled by tycoon Tan Sri Vincent Tan, is injecting a freehold commercial unit in Berjaya Times Square, with a built up area of about 13,369 sq ft, into Berjaya Assets Bhd for RM13.37 million. The lot is currently tenanted to Sports Toto Fitness Sdn Bhd, which runs a fitness centre there, at an annual rental of RM442,368. BAsset's wholly-owned unit Berjaya Times Square Sdn Bhd (BTSSB) inked a sale and purchase agreement with BCredit today, to effect the purchase. BAssets said the property was initially purchased by BCredit for RM10.5 million in 2009. Its net carrying value as at Dec 31, 2015 was RM9.1 million. The property's open market value was RM14.7 million, it added. It said the cash consideration for the proposed acquisition will be funded by internally-generated funds and/or borrowings. BCredit is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Singer (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (Singer), which in turn is a wholly-owned unit of BRetail, in which Tan is the major shareholder by virtue of his 99.99% equity interest in HQZ Credit Sdn Bhd, BRetail's ultimate holding company. Tan is also a major shareholder of BAssets and a director in BTSSB. BAssets said the buy will provide an opportunity for BTSSB, who already owns a substantial part of Berjaya Times Square, to increase its flow space in the mall. The Malaysian Competition Commission (MyCC) has decided to fine MyEG Services Bhd, a total of RM2.27 million and possibly impose daily fines going forward, for \u201cabusing its dominant position in the provision and management of online Foreign Workers Permit renewals.\u201d MyCC found that MyEG, together with MyEG Commerce Sdn Bhd, had infringed section 10(2)(d)(iii) of the (Competition Act 2010) by abusing its dominant position in harming competition in the downstream market, in which MyEG Commerce is participating as an insurance agent for online Foreign Workers Permit renewal applications. There are three remedial actions that MyCC wants MyEG to take. First, the concessionaire of Malaysian E-Government MSC Flagship Application has to immediately stop imposing different conditions to equivalent transactions in the processing of mandatory insurances for online Foreign Workers Permit renewal applications. MyCC next wants MyEG to provide an efficient gateway for all of its competitors in the market sale of the mandatory insurances\u201d, and let these competitors compete at a level-playing field within 60 days from today. Thirdly, MyEG has to provide an undertaking in the form and manner acceptable to MyCC. The company has to then be fully compliant with the rules and regulations of General Insurance Association of Malaysia, also within 60 days. In the event that MyEG does not comply with any of the above-mentioned remedial actions, the commission is at the liberty to impose a higher daily penalty for the subsequent period of non-compliance, said MyCC. Sime Darby Bhd said the results of the United Kingdom\u2019s referendum to exit the European Union will not impact the viability of the Battersea Power Station project. Reiterating its long term commitment as a shareholder of the Battersea Power Station project, the government-linked conglomerate said the project will continue to generate interest in the longer term. The group is confident that the iconic development will continue to generate interest in the longer term and that London will continue to remain a key investment destination and financial centre. In an unprecedented move, UK voters polled for the country to leave the EU, with 52% or 17.41 million voters commanding the winning decision. A total of 48% or 16.14 million voters chose to stay in the EU. Voter turnout was 72.16%. The Battersea Power Station regeneration project, with an estimated gross development value of \u00a310 billion (RM57 billion), involves the redevelopment of London\u2019s iconic Battersea Power Station. Sime Darby and SP Setia Bhd have also jointly invested in the project with 40% stakes each, while the Employee Provident Fund owns the remaining 20%.\n\u00a0\nMeanwhile, Eco World International Bhd (EWI), which is developing three projects in London, is optimistic the Brexit results hold a silver lining for the group and its customers, going forward. EWI, which is set to make its debut on the main market of Bursa Malaysia, also noted that the pound sterling has dropped, which means the cost of its development projects there will be lower. \"If this situation holds, it will also make it cheaper for EWI to acquire new sites, post-listing,\" said EWI vice chairman Tan Sri Liew Kee Sin in a statement. Liew said the results of the Brexit vote \u2014 though largely unexpected \u2014 has finally removed uncertainty which has caused many investors to hold back on decision-making. \"Britain is still a hugely important economy in Europe, with highly principled, professional and competent leaders. I have every confidence that the UK government will do their utmost to take proactive measures to assuage post-Brexit concerns and move the United Kingdom forward on every front,\" he said. Engineering and construction specialist Kimlun Corp Bhd expects its earnings for the current financial year to either be the same or lower than last year, as most mega infrastructure projects in the country are still at early stages and not likely to contribute significantly to its earnings in the immediate- to near-term. Due to the softening property market, the group also expects lower profit contribution from the group's property development. The segment contributed less than 10% to the group's earnings last year. The Group's chief executive officer Sim Tian Liang said the construction sector, which dominated about 80% of the group's revenue in FY15, will still be the main earnings growth driver this year. Sim said the group, which has an order book of RM1.8 billion, is bidding for up to RM3 billion worth of projects. He said it is difficult to estimate as to how much the group can secure from the bids that it has submitted so far, though he shared that Kimlun has a 20% win ratio. Industrial gas and chemical delivery specialist Kelington Group Bhd\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer Raymond Gan said the group's revenue in the current financial year ending Dec 31, 2016 (FY16) is expected to rise on a strong order book. Gan said Kelington's outstanding order book stood at RM250 million and that it managed to secure new orders amounting to RM160 million so far this year. The group is also tendering for RM500 million worth of projects, from which it expects to secure 20% worth of jobs. Among these projects, 40% is from the high-tech industry, while 60% is from the general industry, he said. In FY15, Kelington reported a net loss of RM2.62 million, compared with a net profit of RM5.2 million a year earlier. Revenue was higher at RM206.45 million versus RM189.11 million. Gan said Kelington is expanding its business abroad. He said the group, which had recently expanded its business in the Philippines and Indonesia, is now eyeing Vietnam and Myanmar. Telecommunications player REDtone International Bhd recorded a loss of RM23.53 million or 3.03 sen a share for the fourth quarter ended April 30, on revenue of RM51.81 million. For the 11 months to April 30, the group recorded a net loss of RM29.79 million or 3.81 sen a share, on revenue of RM148.59 million. There were no comparison figures, as the group had changed its financial year end from May 31 to April 30, in line with Berjaya Corporation Bhd\u2019s (BCorp's) financial year end. BCorp took over REDtone on May 8, 2016. REDtone said that its losses were due to high project costs arising from prolonged delay in major projects, high impairment of trade receivables and impairment of goodwill and property, plant and equipment.

Tham now holds a 21% stake in E&O from 11% previously. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, E&O said Tham, via his private investment vehicle Paramount Spring Sdn Bhd, has acquired an additional 125.98 million shares in E&O at RM2.60 per share or RM327.54 million from Sime Darby. This reduces the latter's stake to 12% from 22%. Additionally, Tham acquired all 48.8 million convertible warrants 2015/2019 in E&O held by Sime Darby at 30 sen each. This brings the total transaction price to RM342 million. \"This move to increase my stake in the company is a reflection of my continued conviction and confidence in the E&O Group and the brand that has been built through the years,\" said Tham in a statement today. \"I strongly believe that the group has tremendous potential and I am keen to participate in its long-term growth trajectory,\" he added. Tham noted that Phase 2 of its Seri Tanjung Pinang project (STP2) is underway, with initial mobilisation works in progress upon securing all necessary authorities' approvals. \"This is a catalyst project for E&O, as it is significant for Penang, and I am keen to be even more involved in bringing its concept master plan to reality,\" he said. In a separate statement today, Sime Darby said the stake disposal is part of its asset monetisation plan. \"The share sale forms part of our rationalisation of property investments taking into account opportunities for future growth in areas of strategic significance,\" said Sime Darby president and group chief executive Tan Sri Mohd Bakke Salleh. Sime Darby added that proceeds from the sale will be used for working capital. Sime Darby's latest stake divested is part of a 30% block that the group had acquired in August 2011 for RM2.30 per share in a controversial transaction that had prompted a shareholder of E&O to file a legal suit. It had in July 2014 pared down its stake in E&O after disposing of 9.9% of the shares to Tham at RM2.90 each in a deal worth RM319 million. E&O shares closed unchanged at RM1.59 today, giving it a market capitalisation of RM2 billion.

Notable filings BETWEEN March 21 and 25, notable changes in shareholding in companies listed on Bursa Malaysia include those at Berjaya Auto Bhd. Its holding company, Berjaya Group Bhd, pared down its stake in the automaker by 20 million shares, reducing its interest in the company to 21.89% from 23.65% previously. The holding company has been trimming its stake in the automaker since the beginning of the year. During the same period, the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) acquired 1.03 million shares in the company, increasing its shareholding to 6.52%.  Cybertowers Bhd, which has been suspended since Jan 27, saw the emergence of a new substantial shareholder in Ng Kian Boon, who bought 5.32 million shares. Filings with Bursa show that Ng bought the shares on Jan 27 at an undisclosed price before the stock was suspended on the same day at 0.5 sen. However, based on the company\u2019s proposed regularisation plan to retain its listing status and revive operations, Ng\u2019s stake will be diluted from 5.32% to 0.15% upon the completion of the proposed acquisition, debt settlement and private placement according to the March 18 announcement. At Pesona Metro Holdings Bhd, managing director Wie Hock Beng and director Wie Hock Kiong increased their stakes in the company through Sincere Goldyear Sdn Bhd. Filings with Bursa Malaysia show that the siblings bought 14.83 million shares in the company for 44 sen apiece on March 23. The shares closed at 39 sen on that day, indicating that they paid a 12.8% premium for the shares. Indirectly, the brothers hold 57.63% equity interest in the company, which is involved in the construction sector. The week in review also saw Permodalan Nasional Bhd dispose of 80 million shares in Sime Darby Bhd while its unit trust fund, Skim Amanah Saham Bumiputera, acquired 80 million shares on the same day. According to filings, Skim Amanah Saham Bumiputera\u2019s stake in Sime Darby increased to 42.49% post-acquisition while Permodalan Nasional Bhd is left with 6.25%. The EPF also trimmed its stake in Sime Darby by 7.13 million shares, leaving the provident fund with an 11.78% direct stake. Recently, Fitch Ratings downgraded its credit rating on Sime Darby to \u201cBBB+\u201d from \u201cA\u201d with a negative outlook, on the back of the extended period of high leverage, with the group taking longer than initially anticipated to deleverage, as well as a challenging environment for the industrial business (mainly heavy equipment) and low crude palm oil prices. \u00a0 Notable movements During the week in review, Destini Bhd\u2019s share price first declined 2.75% to 53 sen on March 23, from 54.5 sen on March 21. Thereafter, it rebounded by 5.66% to hit 56 sen on March 25. The share price has continued to climb since then. Last Wednesday, it closed at 58.5 sen. Filings with Bursa show that BPH Capital Sdn Bhd, in which Destini\u2019s group managing director Datuk Rozabil @ Rozamujib Abdul Rahman is an interested party, had disposed of 18 million shares in the company through an off-market transaction on March 24 at 55 sen apiece to Rozabil.

Year to date, the share price of Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) has appreciated about 4.95%, Sime Darby Bhd went up 1.93%, Public Bank Bhd has gained 1.75%, Malayan Banking Bhd rose 5.83%, and Nestle Malaysia Bhd is up 2.18% \u2014 in line with the constant influx of foreign funds. The benchmark FBM KLCI has gained over 100 points over the past few weeks, from touching levels around 1,600 in January, to close at 1,703.79 points last Friday, indicating some steady buying support for index-linked counters. Etiqa Insurance & Takaful head of research Chris Eng attributed the return of foreign funds to the strengthening ringgit, the poor performance of the FBM KLCI over the past two years and the gradual resolution of the 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) issue. \u201cPart of the return has been due to the strengthening ringgit, with hope for more strength, and the poor performance of the Malaysian market over the last two years, with it being among the top three worst-performing regional markets in 2014 and 2015. \u201cThe continued gradual resolution of the 1MDB issue, with the sale of Edra\u2019s (Edra Global Energy Bhd) power assets to Chinese parties is also a positive for the local market,\u201d he told The Edge Financial Daily. At the time of writing, the ringgit weakened 0.19% to trade at 4.0370 against the US dollar, while Brent crude fell 0.07% to US$40.44.\u00a0  Eng said foreign buying will continue in the near term, but expects foreign selling to start picking up in the following month, as the April US corporate results season is likely to disappoint. \u201cA disappointment in US earnings will impact investors\u2019 risk appetite, and it is likely that they will sell off their holdings of global equities,\u201d he explained. Overall, Eng said the buying activity will continue to push up the blue-chips, noting TNB as a good pick, as the stock is a beneficiary of the current hot weather, while the resolution of Edra removed some overhang on the stock. M&A Securities Sdn Bhd head of research Rosnani Rasul cited the improving outlook for the ringgit and oil prices as factors behind the return of foreign funds, which has supported recent gains in index-linked counters. \u201cThe main choice of foreign funds has always been blue-chips, high liquidity and strong balance sheet counters,\u201d she said, adding that the foreign buying activity is expected to continue in the near term. According to MIDF Research\u2019s latest fund flow report, liquidity flow into the Asian region remained elevated for the third consecutive week, with net foreign purchases for the Malaysian bourse exceeding RM1 billion for the second week running, for the trading week ended March 18. It said foreign buyers purchased listed equities amounting to RM1.48 billion, a 42% increase on a week-on-week basis, and were net buyers through every day of the week. During the week, the research house said Maxis Communications Bhd registered the highest net money inflow of RM11.32 million during the week, followed by Sime Darby (RM9.98 million inflow), Public Bank (RM8.45 million inflow) and TNB (RM8.23 million inflow). \u201cThus far in March (until March 18), cumulative net foreign purchases already amounted to RM3.63 billion. Provided there is no break in the momentum of the money flow, the haul in March is set to be the highest since April 2013, which was just before the general election,\u201d said the research house. According to Bloomberg\u2019s consensus, a number of analysts have \u201cbuy\u201d calls on TNB, with a target price of RM15.75, providing 13% upside to its closing price of RM13.98 last Friday."}, "151": {"date_posted": "23/3/2016", "title": "VS Industry, Top Glove, Sime Darby, Poh Huat, Sentoria, CCM Duopharma and Astro", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (March 22): Based on corporate announcements and news flow today, companies that may be in focus tomorrow (Wednesday, March 23) could include the following: VS Industry, Top Glove, Sime Darby, Poh Huat, Sentoria, CCM Duopharma, and Astro.

Australia-based SEE is a monitoring and sensing technology firm listed on the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market (AIM).

In a bourse filing, Top Glove said its wholly-owned subsidiary Top Glove Sdn Bhd (TGSB) has entered into a JV agreement with DHS today, which will see the JV partners acquiring TG GD Medical Clinic Sdn Bhd as the JV company. The ultimate equity structure of the JV is 75% TGSB and 25% DHS. Top Glove said Global Doctors Malaysia will grant the sole and exclusive transferable rights, licence and privilege to use the intellectual property and know-how developed by the hospital chain to TG GD for a fee that will be mutually agreed on by both TGSB and DHS. Moody's Investors Service said Sime Darby Bhd's sale of perpetual sukuk still leaves the company needing to lower its dependence on short-term funding for Malaysia's biggest listed palm-oil producer to reduce the chances of a further ratings downgrade, according to Bloomberg. Sime Darby issued RM2.2 billion (US$544 million) of Islamic notes with no set maturity this month via private placement to yield 5.65%, said people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the information isn't public. The securities, which are treated as equity rather than debt on a company's balance sheet, will pay a step-up rate of 100 basis points, if they aren't redeemed after the 10th year. The offering, which was Malaysia's biggest perpetual sukuk, is part of measures undertaken by Sime Darby to reduce debt that swelled 74% to RM19.7 billion in the 18 months ended Dec 31, after the acquisition of New Britain Palm Oil Ltd in Papua New Guinea. Poh Huat Resources Bhd saw its net profit soar 73% to RM14.14 million or 6.62 sen per share for the first quarter ended Jan 31, 2016 (1QFY16), from RM8.18 million or 3.83 sen per share in the previous year, partly due to the stronger US dollar during the period. The furniture maker's revenue for the quarter rose 44% to RM151.06 million, from RM105.09 million in 1QFY15. In its filing with the bourse, the group attributed the better revenue to higher volume of shipments by its Malaysian and Vietnam operations, as well as the stronger US dollar during the quarter. Sentoria Group Bhd announced two contract wins totalling RM110 million, consisting of a design and build contract for one block of apartment in Sepang, Selangor, worth RM20 million, and another for the development of 800 units of single-storey terrace houses in Kuantan, Pahang, worth RM90 million. In its filing today, the group said it intends to fund works for both contracts through a combination of internally generated funds and bank borrowings. Works for the Sepang project commenced on March 21, 2016, and is expected to be completed by March 20, 2019. The Kuantan development had also commenced on March 21, with completion targeted by March 31, 2020. CCM Duopharma Biotech Bhd (CCMD) plans to construct a new plant and a warehouse in Taman Klang Jaya, Selangor, at an estimated cost of RM103.7 million and RM37.1 million, respectively. \"The new state of the art plant which consists of two adjoining blocks will be equipped with enhanced cGMP (current good manufacturing practices) facilities to cater for existing businesses and increased product offerings including specialty product. \"Meanwhile, the new purpose-designed warehouse with roof top car park amenities will accommodate existing operations and cater for future warehousing needs of CCMD's business.

The new plant will expand its capacity by approximately 40% to 50%, after its targeted completion within the fourth quarter of 2018. Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd's net profit jumped 45.58% year-on-year to RM203.77 million in its fourth quarter ended Jan 31, 2016 (4QFY16), from RM139.97 million a year ago. The better net profit was mainly due to an increase in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of RM27 million, lower net finance cost by RM30 million and an increase in the share of post-tax results from investment accounted for of RM12.9 million. Revenue for the quarter under review grew 3.97% to RM1.4 billion, compared to RM1.35 billion in the corresponding quarter a year ago. Astro declared a fourth interim single-tier dividend of 2.75 sen per ordinary share, with its shares to trade ex on April 4, payable on April 21.

While the EPF still keeps just over 50% of its assets in fixed income instruments, including government bonds and other investment grade debt paper, it should be no surprise in the current low yield environment that interest from fixed income instruments only brought in 35% to 40% of its annual investment income from 2013 to 2015. It is worth noting, however, that dividends from local stocks could have contributed up to a quarter of the EPF\u2019s earnings in 2015, back-of-the-envelope calculations show. Can investors also profit from tracking the EPF? Based on its top 30 domestic equity holdings as at end-2015, it is estimated that dividend income from these stocks came up to between RM1.8 billion and RM3.2 billion \u2014 that is easily 15% to 25% of the EPF\u2019s local equities income for 2015 \u2014 assuming that local equities accounted for 50% of its equities income, or RM13 billion. The EPF acknowledged the contribution from the equities asset class when it declared its record dividend payout of RM38.24 billion for 2015, up 4.3% from RM36.66 billion in 2014 (albeit on a lower 6.4% rate versus 2014\u2019s 6.75%, but still above fixed deposit rates and the risk-free rate of below 4%). \u201cDuring the year in review, equities continued to be the main contributor of income with 58.81% amounting to RM26.01 billion, up 13.54% compared with RM22.91 billion in 2014,\u201d its Feb 20 statement read. The EPF went on to say that \u201cthe foreign equity portfolio played a significant role in 2015 by generating more than 50% of the income from equity investment\u201d. The significance of dividend income from investments in local equities to total earnings goes up if foreign equities account for a lot more than 50% of equities income in 2015. The EPF reports its top 30 local equity holdings on a quarterly basis but not foreign equities. What is known is that EPF CEO Datuk Shahril RIdza Ridzuan previously said the EPF invests in quality blue-chips overseas, much like its domestic strategy. It is estimated that the EPF\u2019s foreign assets were worth about RM171.13 billion, given that they make up 25% of the provident fund\u2019s total investment assets of RM684.53 billion as at end-2015. According to its 2015 earnings briefing slides, 43.4% of the EPF\u2019s foreign assets are in Asia, of which 97% were in equities. A quarter of its foreign assets were in North America, of which 60% were in equities and 39% fixed income. Europe accounted for 22.9% of investment assets, of which 64% were in equities. Australia has an allocation of 5.2%, of which 29% was in equities and 56% in fixed income instruments. At 25% (RM171 billion) in 2015, the growth in the proportion of foreign assets to local assets has slowed year on year, from 23% (RM146 billion) in 2014. Foreign assets accounted for 20% (about RM118 billion) of the EPF\u2019s total assets in 2013, 17% (about RM90 billion) in 2012 and 13% (about RM61 billion) in 2011. But, just like the equities asset class, the EPF\u2019s foreign assets accounted for a significantly higher portion of total earnings in 2015 \u2014 a testament to its structured overseas investment programme, which it said \u201cformally started in 2006\u201d. Overseas income was also higher in ringgit terms with the ringgit sharply lowere last year.\u00a0 Despite making up only 25% of total investment size, foreign investments contributed 48% of the EPF\u2019s total RM44.23 billion investment income in 2015, \u201cthus outperforming domestic assets\u201d, EPF chairman Tan Sri Samsudin Osman said in the Feb 20 statement. The EPF is reportedly looking to increase its foreign assets to 27% over the coming two years to diversify its portfolio. It is worth noting, however, that the EPF\u2019s foreign assets touched 27% as at end-September 2015. It is not immediately certain why foreign assets reduced from 3Q2015 to 4Q2015, but the change in the strength of the ringgit could be a factor. To the question of whether the EPF faces constraints in diversifying overseas, given Putrajaya\u2019s recent instruction to repatriate foreign investments, the EPF CEO reportedly said the government had never stopped the EPF from acquiring overseas assets as it understood the need for diversification. Another outperformer is the predictable income stream from the alternative investment class, namely the real estate and infrastructure asset class, which contributed RM1.7 billion in investment income in 2015, up 22.2% from 2014. This asset class \u2014 which includes foreign investments and was initiated in 2010, which the EPF said \u201cshowed encouraging performance\u201d \u2014 reportedly accounts for about 4% of total earnings, while making up 3% of total assets. The intent is to have this asset class make up about 8% to 10% of investments over the next three to five years. For investors interested in tracking the EPF\u2019s equities investments, a quick comparison of its top 30 local stock investments found that it broadly increased its holdings in stocks whose prices ended lower year on year in 2015, except for Media Prima Bhd, Sime Darby Bhd and IJM Plantations Bhd, in which the provident fund reduced its exposure even as stock prices fell. Similarly, the EPF pared holdings in stocks whose prices ended higher year on year in 2015, except for Public Bank Bhd, United Plantations Bhd, IJM Corp Bhd and Dialog Group Bhd, in which it raised holdings year on year, even as share prices rose. It should be noted that an end-2014 to end-2015 holdings comparison only shows a year-on-year change in portfolio standings and is simplistic as it might not capture a change in buy or sell directions between the 12 months. Put another way, the EPF and its portfolio managers could have taken profit while share prices moved higher and bought shares again when prices fell. According to stock exchange filings, as at Feb 24 this year, the EPF was still buying United Plantations and Dialog while paring its exposure to Sime Darby and IJM Plantations. It is also worth noting that purchases of BIMB Holdings Bhd shares were among the largest year-on-year increases in shareholding by the EPF among its top 30 domestic equity holdings. As at end-2015, the EPF held 12.6% of BIMB, up more than 3% from 9.49% at end-2014. The EPF\u2019s stake in BIMB rose further to 12.99% as at Feb 22, stock exchange filings show. The EPF also bought Tenaga Nasional Bhd shares, which fell on fears of it overpaying for acquisitions as well as a surprise tax bill. Other sizeable year-on-year increases in holdings in 2015 were banking stocks, including Malayan Banking Bhd, where its shareholding went from 13.3% as at end-2014 to 17.06% at end-2015, but this had been reduced to 15.49% at the time of writing. The EPF also raised its stake in CIMB Group Holdings Bhd from 14.65% as at end-2014 to 17.41% at end-2015 while it currently holds 16.92%. The EPF\u2019s shareholding in AMMB Holdings Bhd rose from 14.36% as at end-2014 to 16.45% at end-2015 and stood at 15.98% at the time of writing. [See table] Meanwhile, a new addition to its top 30 holdings list last year was Malakoff Corp Bhd, which had an initial public offering in May last year. The EPF reduced its equity interest from 30% to 17.45% by offering part of its stake for sale. Its shareholding was 18.83% as at end-2015 but had fallen to 17.5% at the time of writing. More importantly, 90% of the EPF\u2019s top 30 investments paid some form of dividend in 2014 and at least 60% are likely to do the same for 2015. In 2014, total dividends from its top 30 holdings are estimated at RM3.2 billion. While the reporting season for 2015 was still ongoing at the time of writing, back-of-the-envelope calculations show that at least RM1.8 billion had been paid to the EPF by those that have announced FY2015 dividends \u2014 a testament to the importance of yield to bolster one\u2019s portfolio.

THE mood was somber in the ballroom of Sime Darby Bhd\u2019s convention centre in Mont\u2019Kiara, where the diversified group released its half-year financial earnings. As president and group CEO Tan Sri Mohd Bakke Salleh took his seat at the briefing, he hardly smiled. \u201cWhile profit before tax (PBT) fell 22% year on year [to RM463.5 million for the second quarter ended Dec 31], turnover actually increased by 10% y-o-y [to RM11.83 billion]. This should tell you a lot about the environment we are operating in today,\u201d Bakke told the press last Wednesday. Sime Darby, which has grown enormously in size in the past decade, is likely to remain profitable in the current financial year ending June 30 (FY2016). But the cyclical downturn may hit it hard, despite its well diversified core businesses \u2014 plantations, industrial, automotive and property \u2014 with no reprieve in sight. A few quarters of weak earnings due to poor macroeconomic conditions aren\u2019t just short-term problems for Sime Darby. The quarterly numbers might have exposed the group\u2019s vulnerability to the fluctuation of commodity prices. Some quarters wonder what Sime Darby would look like if it hadn\u2019t gone on the acquisition trail. Furthermore, the conglomerate usually surprises the investing fraternity with the premium prices it is willing to pay for acquisitions. Young fund managers might not see Sime Darby as an exciting name or a must-have blue-chip that would enable their investment portfolios to outperform their peers\u2019. \u201cFrom a debt perspective [Sime Darby\u2019s sukuk, for example], GLCs [government-linked companies] like Sime Darby are great because they are good paymasters. From an equities perspective, however, the appeal is harder to see. The group isn\u2019t good at realising the value of its assets,\u201d says one fund manager. \u201cIf you want exposure to plantations, there are other plantation companies that don\u2019t have Sime Darby\u2019s issues. If you want exposure to property development, there are better developers out there that can give you more value. To top it off, Sime Darby doesn\u2019t look very cheap because its share price is well supported by its shareholders,\u201d he says. For the six-months ended Dec 31, net profit fell 36% y-o-y to RM601.7 million, coming in below analysts\u2019 expectations. Revenue grew 5.4% y-o-y to RM22 billion. The timing and acquisition price of New Britain Palm Oil Ltd (NBPOL) last year are debatable. Some fund managers see it underscoring the conglomerate\u2019s struggle to create value. That said, the RM6.07 billion NBPOL acquisition did help to lift Sime Darby\u2019s revenue by adding 80,000ha of palm oil plantations in Papua New Guinea that are deemed to be prime assets. However, the plantation arm, which makes up 40% of PBT, still performed poorly overall due to low crude palm oil prices, poor weather and an export levy imposed by Indonesia. Even with a contribution of 749,000 tonnes of fresh fruit bunch production (FFB) from NBPOL, PBT for the plantation segment fell 17.7% y-o-y to RM460.4 million. Note that NBPOL\u2019s contribution made up about 14% of the group\u2019s total FFB production of 5.4 million tonnes during the period. \u201cThe severe drought has reduced the contribution from NBPOL, but overall, the synergy from the acquisition is positive. It is good for the company\u2019s long-term sustainability,\u201d says Kenaga Research analyst, Voon Yee Ping. Notably, the PBT includes RM101.5 million from the midstream and downstream operations for the period, compared with a loss of RM1 million in the previous year. In addition, exchange gains for the settlement of intercompany balances of RM50.7 million were recognised during the period. Stripping out these items, the group\u2019s upstream plantation business actually saw a contraction of 44.8% in PBT to RM308.2 million. The group\u2019s diversified nature hasn\u2019t helped it to diversify earnings risks. With commodity prices at rock-bottom levels, prospects for Sime Darby\u2019s Australia-based industrial segment continue to deteriorate. The slowdown in the property market isn\u2019t doing Sime Darby any favours either, and to top it off, automotive sales are expected contract for the first time in four years (see table above). Weak earnings are putting pressure on the group to deleverage its balance sheet or risk a ratings downgrade. Last year, rating agency Moody\u2019s Investors Service had already revised the outlook on Sime Darby\u2019s A3 rating to negative because \u201cthe A3 rating is not sustainable at four times leverage [debt/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda)],\u201d it wrote. Moody\u2019s revision came after the NBPOL acquisition, which has increased Sime Darby\u2019s gearing to 61%. \u201cThe outlook is negative and could crystallise into a downgrade if substantial debt reduction fails to materialise in the next six months, such that adjusted debt/Ebitda remains above 2.5 times,\u201d Moody\u2019s writes. Bakke is finding ways to address the ballooning debts. He hopes to monetise RM1.8 billion in assets at end-March and launch up to RM3 billion in perpetual sukuk by the middle of the year, in order to reduce the group\u2019s gearing to 54%. Operationally, however, Sime Darby is pretty much in line with its peers of a similar size (see table 2). For the six-month period, Sime Darby\u2019s annualised FFB yield was slightly above 21 tonnes per hectare, well above the national average of 18 to 19 tonnes per hectare. Still, Bakke admits that there is room for improvement.  \u201cOur yield is about one tonne less than some of our peers. That one tonne is a lot when you add it up. This is something that we are addressing through replanting,\u201d says Bakke. While replanting will take many years to bear fruit, Bakke has more pressing concerns. Some analysts do not think the current monetisation plan to pare down borrowings will be sufficient. \u201cThe RM1.8 billion asset monetisation is a start, but Sime will need to do more. Management has mentioned previously that it will look to monetise non-core businesses, as well as some of its property development landbank. Tesco and the group\u2019s hospitality business could be some non-core assets to monetise,\u201d says one analyst. However, monetising assets to reduce its gearing isn\u2019t exactly a draw for investors. Permodalan Nasional Bhd controls 48.7% of Sime Darby while the Employees Provident Fund holds 12.7%. Likewise, Kenanga\u2019s Voon points out that Sime Darby will continue to be an important stock for funds to have their portfolios due to the sheer size of the group\u2019s assets. \u201cSime Darby has the largest plantation landbank among Malaysian planters and is the largest CPO producer following the acquisition of NBPOL,\u201d she says. But Sime Darby cannot ride on its size forever. At some point, it will have to achieve its own tagline, \u201cDeveloping Sustainable Futures\u201d. \u00a0"}, "154": {"date_posted": "7/3/2016", "title": "Sime Darby Property launches mobile app", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (March 7): Sime Darby Bhd's real estate arm Sime Darby Property launched its mobile app to tap a larger customer base within Malaysia and abroad.

Sime Darby president and group chief executive Tan Sri Mohd Bakke Salle said in a separate statement that Sime Darby's lower profit was due to weak commodity prices, adverse weather conditions and a challenging macroeconomic environment. During 2QFY16, Mohd Bakke said plantation income fell on lower profit from upstream operations. He said Sime Darby registered lower average crude palm oil price at RM2,066 a tonne versus RM2,123 a year earlier. \"We are halfway through the earnings reporting period and the numbers reflect the challenging business environment that the group operates in.

Wahab was instrumental in steering Sime Darby in the Malaysian-led consortium to redevelop Battersea Power Station, one of the best known landmarks in London. Prior to his time with Sime Darby, Wahab was the former group chief executive of Kumpulan Guthrie Bhd and Golden Hope Plantations Bhd. He has also held various management and board positions in companies in various sectors in Malaysia, Europe and Asia, covering plantation, property, construction, manufacturing and services. He has also held various board positions in government and government-linked companies. At 3.13pm, Sime Darby shares were trading down 10\u00a0sen, or 1.33%, today at RM7.40, for\u00a0a market capitalisation of RM46.69 billion.

Firstly, the timing of the deal was good \u2014 it was concluded when crude palm oil prices were weakening and headed for a downward trend. Notwithstanding the softening CPO prices, Kulim managed to get an 85% premium on NBPOL\u2019s closing price on the London Stock Exchange from Sime Darby, as it is rare for such a quality and sizeable asset to come into the market. Sime Darby offered Kulim RM2.75 billion for its 49% stake. Meanwhile, Kulim proposed to reward its shareholders and pay RM1 billion (78 sen per share) in dividends, staggered over a two-year period. Kulim announced that another RM850 million would be utilised to either grow its existing businesses or acquire other fundamentally strong assets with growth prospects. The company also plans to use RM600 million to pare down its borrowings, and RM300 million for working capital. To recap, NBPOL has close to 80,000ha of planted oil palm, more than 7,700ha of sugar cane plantation and 9,200ha of grazing pasture. Its plantation business has among the highest yields in the world and is 100% certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, which adds to its appeal. NBPOL also owns 12 oil mills, two refineries \u2014 in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Liverpool, the UK \u2014 and a plant breeding and seed production facility. The company\u2019s 20,375 head of cattle make it PNG\u2019s largest beef producer. Kulim\u2019s adviser, RHB Investment Bank Bhd, ran a competitive auction process and achieved a great result for both its client and the minority shareholders of NBPOL. According to news reports, the bidders for Kulim\u2019s stake in NBPOL were a star-studded cast. Apart from Sime Darby, they were Singapore\u2019s Wilmar International Ltd, Indonesian plantation outfits Sinar Mas Group and RGE Group as well as Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd, IOI Corp Bhd and Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd. The sale also bags the top prize due to the multiple jurisdictions \u2014 and high execution risks \u2014 involved. RHB had to understand the rules of PNG\u2019s Port Moresby Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange, not to mention the requirements of Bursa Malaysia. It also had to obtain the green light from the European Union. Just a year before selling NBPOL to Sime Darby, Kulim had sought to increase its shareholding in the company by 20% and offered RM812.3 million in total, but its plan was thwarted by the Securities Commission of PNG and National Court of PNG. As at mid-December, Kulim\u2019s share price has gained more than 40%.

When contacted for details about the proposed disposal, Sime Darby Property Bhd acting managing director Datuk Ir Jauhari Hamidi tells The Edge: \u201cSime Darby Property is open to business opportunities, including divestments that capture the desired value [which he does not reveal] of its portfolio. However, to date, we have not officially concluded any transaction on Equatorial Melaka.\u201d Two weeks ago, Sime Darby president and CEO Tan Sri Mohd Bakke Salleh told a press conference that the group was weighing several options to pare down its borrowings, including the possibility of monetising its assets. It intends to reduce its gearing level to 0.5 times from 0.6 times now. It is learnt that several interested parties have viewed the 18-year-old, 496-room hotel, which is located in Bandar Hilir Melaka, not far from the popular historical sites of A\u2019Famosa and The Stadthuys. According to an executive in the hotel industry, the asking price for the leasehold asset is around RM180 million, of which RM100 million is for the property and the remaining RM80 million to assume the debt of Syarikat Malacca Straits Inn Sdn Bhd, which owns the hotel. Sime Darby (fundamental: 0.80; valuation: 1.40) holds the majority stake in Syarikat Malacca Straits Inn through wholly owned Sime Darby Property. According to the conglomerate\u2019s FY2015 annual report, Sime Darby Property\u2019s stake in Syarikat Malacca Straits Inn is 55%. However, a search on the Companies Commission of Malaysia (CCM) website shows the stake to be 61.15%. Perbadanan Melaka Holdings, which is wholly owned by Perbadanan Kemajuan Negeri Melaka, holds 22.17% equity interest in the asset while Hotel Equatorial (M) Sdn Bhd has 16.67%. The largest shareholder of Hotel Equatorial (M) is Twintrees Hotels Sdn Bhd. Incidentally, Hotel Equatorial (M) is rebuilding Hotel Equatorial Kuala Lumpur in Jalan Sultan Ismail, next to the Kenanga International building. The hotel is making way for Equatorial Plaza, which will comprise a 52-storey block with a podium, office tower and hotel, and is expected to be ready in three years. In Sime Darby\u2019s annual report for its financial year ended June 30, 2015 (FY2015), the net book value of the 22-storey Hotel Equatorial Melaka stands at RM81.4 million and the lease on the property expires between 2072 and 2075. According to filings with CCM, Syarikat Malacca Straits Inn\u2019s revenue in FY2014 dropped to RM42.66 million from RM44.17 million in the previous year. Net profit, however, was higher at RM7.09 million compared with RM6.94 million. Since FY2010, the highest net profit achieved by Hotel Equatorial Melaka was RM12.59 million in FY2012. Total liabilities in FY2014 stood at RM85.19 million, of which RM10.36 million\u2019s worth were current, while accumulated losses amounted to RM20.36 million. In 2009, Sime Darby had appointed an exclusive agent to handle the sale of the hotel for around the same price. However, no deal was signed. It is unclear if the company has hired an agent this time around. Hotel Equatorial Melaka has seen better days. It was built as a five-star hotel but has lost some of its edge over the years. In fact, The Edge understands that in addition to the purchase price, the new owner would have to spend another RM25 million to RM50 million on refurbishment to upgrade the hotel\u2019s facilities in order to maintain its five-star status.  \u201cThe facilities are five-star but the condition is three-star, so it would need some RM50 million for refurbishment,\u201d says a hotel operator. Other than the hotel in Melaka, Sime Darby\u2019s hospitality properties include Harvard Golf & Country Club and Hotel in Kedah, Darby Park Executive Suites in Singapore and Karri Valley Resort in Western Australia. Its hospitality involvement is also through its 21.8% stake, as at Aug 6, in Eastern & Oriental Bhd (fundamental: 1.10; valuation: 1.10). E&O owns and operates the E&O Hotel and Lone Pine Hotel in Penang.

The F4GBM index measures the performance of public listed companies (PLCs) demonstrating strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices, and was launched in December 2014, with a total of 24 constituents comprising PLCs from across the small, medium and large market capitalisation segments. Index constituents are drawn from the 200 shortlisted companies on the FTSE Bursa Malaysia EMAS Index and reviewed in June and December, against international benchmarks developed in collaboration with FTSE. Bursa Malaysia's chief executive officer Datuk Tajuddin Atan said it has been a year since the launch of the F4GBM index, in which Bursa Malaysia became the first exchange in Asia, with a globally benchmarked ESG index. \u201cWe have since continued to engage the market, specifically our PLCs, investment banks, brokers and investors, to deepen the understanding of the requirements and propositions of being on the index, and the feedback has been positive,\" he said in a statement today. \u201cOur new ESG constituents represent a diverse group of companies from different sectors and from the three market cap segments, which is positive, as this indicates that market quality extends beyond our large cap companies,\u201d he added.

Bursa Malaysia has been one of the key drivers of sustainability in Malaysia. In 2015, the local bourse became a partner exchange on the Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative and also by developing the CAP 10 ASEAN Sustainability Series, which included playing host to the World Federation of Exchanges Sustainability Working Group and the Global Sustainability & Impact Investing Forum in July, and launching the Sustainability Guide and Toolkits at the Sustainability Symposium in October. Over the past decade, Bursa\u2019s sustainability journey has included the introduction of the Bursa Malaysia Corporate Responsibility framework in 2006, followed by the Shariah-based indices and corporate governance guidelines for listed companies in 2007 and the launch of the F4GBM Index in 2014."}, "166": {"date_posted": "14/12/2015", "title": "Icon Offshore, PetDag, Sime Darby, Comfort Gloves, Pasdec, Ideal Sun City, Fututech and FGV", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Dec 11): Based on corporate news flow and announcements today, stocks in focus next Monday (Dec 14) could include: Icon Offshore, PetDag, Sime Darby, Comfort Gloves, Pasdec, Ideal Sun City, Fututech and FGV.

Petronas Dagangan Bhd (PetDag) will be divesting its Vietnamese businesses after its wholly-owned subsidiary PDB (Netherlands) B.V (PDBN) entered into two share sale and purchase agreements (SSPAs) with Totalgaz Vietnam Ltd, as part of the group's portfolio rationalisation strategy. The SSPAs with Totalgaz will see the divestment of PDBN's entire 100% equity interests in Petronas (Vietnam) Co Ltd and Thang Long LPG Company Ltd. The group said both companies, incorporated in Vietnam, are involved in the bottling and distribution of liquefied petroleum gas in Vietnam. The divestment is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2016, subject to the conditions of the SSPAs being met. Major oil palm growers, including Malaysia's Sime Darby Bhd will conduct trials of a sustainable cultivation scheme under the Sustainable Palm Oil Manifesto. Companies including Sime Darby, Singapore-based Musim Mas and the US' Cargill Inc are signatories of the manifesto, which advocates the high carbon stock (HCS) scheme launched today. Sime Darby said the HCS methodology was built on three pillars. The list comprises ecosystem maintenance, socio-economic benefits for local communities and economic viability. Sime Darby's unit, Sime Darby Plantation Sdn Bhd's managing director Datuk Franki Anthony Dass said the group intended to carry out trials at its oil palm plantations in Liberia. He said Liberia was chosen, because Sime Darby's estimated 10,000 ha of plantations there, were the group's only greenfield development. Comfort Gloves Bhd's performance in its third quarter ended Oct 31, 2015 (3QFY16) continued to show the fruits of its expansion exercise this year, when net profit came in almost 11 times higher year-on-year (y-o-y) at RM7.17 million, from RM672,000 previously. Revenue for the quarter under review rose 59.6% y-o-y to RM61.28 million, from RM38.39 million, according to the company's Bursa Malaysia filing today. The company was formerly known as Integrated Rubber Corp Bhd. On a cumulative basis (9MFY16), Comfort Gloves' net profit rose a little over 10 times to RM16.26 million, from RM1.59 million; while revenue came in 51.2% higher y-o-y at RM171.2 million, from RM113.22 million previously. Looking ahead, Comfort Gloves said it expects the demand and consumption of rubber gloves in Asia and other emerging economies to increase, on the back of rising awareness in healthcare. As such, it expects it will continue to capture a bigger market share in Asia and United States, which currently contributes 80% to its revenue. Pasdec Holdings Bhd, a 51.65%-owned subsidiary of the Pahang state government, has warned it will slip into its first full-year net loss this financial year ending Dec 31, 2015 (FY15), after three years of profits, mainly due to higher expenses incurred from the relocation of its automotive manufacturing operations from South Africa to Botswana. For the nine months period ended Sept 30, 2015 (9MFY15), the group reported a net loss of RM18.13 million, compared with a net profit of RM981,000 a year ago, dragged by relocation, training and retrenchment costs, following the relocation of its auto manufacturing activities. Revenue fell 4% to RM145.86 million, from RM151.96 million. Pasdec's senior vice-president of corporate resources, Goh Song Han, said it would likely take another year for the business to turn around in FY17. Goh said the group is also looking to balance its business portfolio between property development and auto manufacturing in the next two to three years. For now, the property segment which accounted for 47% of its revenue in 9MFY15, will remain the main contributor to the group\u2019s turnover, while the group waits for the auto manufacturing business in Botswana to stabilize. Today, Pasdec also signed a share subcription agreement with BDC to formalise the group's commitment to invest in Botswana. Under the joint venture (JV), Pasdec will hold a 70% stake in the JV company, Pasdec Automotive Technologies Proprietary Botswana Ltd (PAT BW), while BDC will own the remaining 30% shares. PAT BW's chief executive officer Datuk Kevin Pather noted that the total investment to construct the Botswana plant is around US$15 million, which will cater to the auto market in the northern and central African regions. In the next 18 to 24 months, Pather said PAT BW will invest around US$10 million in the Botswana plant, that will cater to its two major customers \u2014 Volkswagen and Nissan/Renault \u2014 in the immediate term.

Ooi had disposed of 41.39 million shares of the company, representing a 22.29% indirect stake, on Nov 13. After the disposal, Ooi is left with a 0.96% indirect stake.

The companies are finalising the price, Rajawali's managing director Darjoto Setyawan told Reuters in a text message interview. Last month, the Malaysian group's main unit, Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd (FGV), said it needed to rethink its planned purchase of a 37% stake in Eagle High for USUS$680 million, after its shareholders criticised the deal as too expensive. The deal was set to be biggest acquisition so far for Felda Global, the world's no. 3 palm plantation operator, which has been looking to expand its landbank. Under the new deal, Felda Global may take less than 10% in Eagle High, with the remainder bought by Felda Investment, a separate unit of Felda Group. In response to the Rajawali comments, Felda Global said in a statement that it was continuing to evaluate a possible different mode of investment in Eagle High and that an announcement would be made in 2016. Shares of Eagle High jumped 8.1% in afternoon trade today. It closed at IDR132, up 18.92%. FGV ended 1.9% higher at RM1.61.

Speaking to reporters at the HCS launch, Raison said the scheme involved mapping of concession areas to identify the size and location of forest patches and surrounding land under the concession. He said this would help companies determine areas with high cultivation potential and forested areas, which needed to be preserved. \"The carbon mapping part is not too expensive. The advantage is that it helps equip companies with information on where to build drainage, roads and so on,\" Raison said.

Data from the National Property Information Centre\u2019s (Napic) First Half Property Market Report shows that during the first six months of the year, the total value of property transactions declined 6% year on year to RM77.08 billion. In terms of volume, property transactions fell 3.5% to 186,618. The residential segment saw a 2.6% drop in transaction volume but its value took a 9.7% dive to RM36.4 billion. The report will make sobering reading for many younger households who, for years, have seen property prices only move northwards. Between 2009 and 2014, the Malaysian House Price Index registered a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.1%. It marked a period of sharp acceleration compared with 5.6% for the period between 2000 and 2014. This rapid growth in an otherwise sedate domestic property sector came on the back of ample liquidity that flooded the market following the global financial crisis in 2008. Predictably, grumbles that houses were too expensive for the hardworking middle class emerged. The government attempted to halt this price growth by stopping free-flowing mortgages and stepping efforts to combat speculative activities as early as 2011. Price growth slowed but it was not till 2015 that growth in residential property deals stalled. This year, property developers are struggling with sales. Few are selling or building properties at rates seen during the housing boom and Napic reported that property stock, which stood at 4.87 million units in 1Q2015, grew to 4.89 million units in 2Q2015. At the same time, new launches fell 12.8% in 1H2015 year on year while unsold units under construction rose a whopping 32.7%. These unsold residential units have started to subtly drive prices down. Napic\u2019s numbers indicate that as at 2Q2015, the Malaysian House Price Index was at 220.2 points, up 5.9% y-o-y. The rate of increase of the index has been slowing since 3Q2015. \u201cHouse prices have definitely come down. If you don\u2019t see them, it is because property developers have started to offer rebates, discounts or other incentives like free legal fees or stamp duties, which will lower the amount you pay for the property in the end,\u201d says Chang Kim Loong, secretary-general of the National House Buyers Association. If the additional supply is helping to moderate property prices, then some will find Napic\u2019s data on incoming supply comforting. It reported that Malaysia had incoming supply of 795,372 residential properties in 1Q2015, which increased to 831,186 in 2Q2015.\u00a0 While private developers are more cautious about adding on to that, the government is not. Based on the 11th Malaysia Plan, the government, through various housing programmes, targets to deliver 653,000 new housing units from 2016 to 2020. The sum excludes many state housing schemes. For the middle class in particular, the 1Malaysia People\u2019s Housing (PR1MA) programme should be adding an extra half a million affordable homes by 2018. The bulk of the promised 500,000 units should enter the market in 2017 and 2018. Lest we forget, there is also the government\u2019s directive to government-linked companies to build 800 units in Bandar Kwasa Damansara and for Sime Darby Property to build 4,600 units of affordable homes. Also reassuring for aspiring homeowners is that those in the business of building homes \u00a0are not expecting property prices to see a surge. They tell The Edge that growth in house prices is likely to stagnate in the near term, as buyers looking for new properties and prepared for the added debt burden are denied owing to lending restrictions. Bina Puri Holdings Bhd executive director Matthew Tee says, \u201cI expect property prices to remain at current levels, with growth capped by the current regulatory environment. I don\u2019t see prices coming down too much because the cost of development is very high. Land and other costs are still going up.\u201d Ken Holdings Bhd\u2019s Sam Tan says, \u201cThe property development business is not as easy as it used to be. You have to offer more amenities, and provide connectivity and infrastructure to attract buyers. Developers\u2019 profit margins are thinning due to rising costs and slowing market. \u201cIt depends on what you build and how you price your product. The bread-and-butter properties \u2014 those priced between RM300,000 and RM500,000 \u2014 will still sell. But, generally speaking, you will not see a surge in prices anytime soon.\u201d So, are moderating residential property prices arising from an increase in supply the answer to the housing affordability woes of the middle class? MIDF Research economist Izzuddin Yusuf doesn\u2019t believe that is the case. Property prices have swelled too much over the last few years for a small tapering off to count. Affordability is still an issue for most middle-income earners looking to live under their own roof. \u201cI think the idea of affordable housing has changed recently for the public, to a point that it is considered affordable so long as you are eligible for a bank loan.  \u201cProperty prices are currently at a level that is still unaffordable for \u2018real demand\u2019, meaning those who buy in order to live in the property, even as speculative buying has slowed significantly. From here, property prices will probably grow at a very slow pace and it will be a while before they become affordable for most first-time buyers,\u201d he says. Indeed, Khazanah Research Institute\u2019s (KRI) study, \u201cMaking Housing Affordable\u201d, found that the the median price for the Malaysian housing market exceeded the three times median annual household \u2014 the threshold for affordability. The general median price stood at4.4 times in 2014 \u2014 a seriously unaffordable level. In cities like Kuala Lumpur and Penang, residential properties were \u201cseverely unaffordable\u201d. Launches were priced way above the affordable threshold of RM274,320 for the capital city and RM168,272 for Penang. Implicit in KRI\u2019s statistics is that house prices \u2014 soaring or moderating \u2014 is not the only variable that determines if a middle-class household can afford to buy a property. It also has to do with income level and growth in disposable income. \u201cHousing affordability is not simply about having cheaper houses \u2026 For a house to be affordable, it means that the purchaser has the budget to pay for the home,\u201d says Teh Lip Kim, managing director of Selangor Dredging Bhd. Ken Holdings\u2019 Tan says, \u201cWe try to build affordable homes and what is being sought after, but people still have to be able to buy them. People are now in a situation where banks are tightening lending requirements. [They also] have one or more banking loans to service and face a higher cost of living.\u201d \u201cTo buy a property, you need the additional disposable income. While wages in Malaysia are growing and the employment rate is good, they are not growing as fast as property prices. The higher your income, the more affordable a house will be to you.\u201d Further, socially popular regulations that stifle property price growth may help quiet public complaints about housing affordability, but won\u2019t do more than that for the Malaysian economy. Not only does the construction sector contribute directly to the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) but it also has a strong multiplier effect. As it also affects sectors like finance, building materials, logistics, infrastructure development and job creation, it is unlikely that a prolonged sluggishness in property prices is what the government wants. Rajiv Biswas, chief economist at IHS, says, \u201cThe construction sector in Malaysia accounted for 4.3% of GDP in 2014, based on government data. Therefore, the size of the sector is significant and any significant slowdown would act as a drag on GDP growth. \u201cTherefore, if the private sector residential construction sector experiences a downturn, the overall impact on total construction activity could be reduced by stronger public sector spending on affordable housing and public infrastructure projects.\u201d But even as growth in home prices is losing steam, the dream of home ownership may still remain elusive to the middle class."}, "169": {"date_posted": "26/11/2015", "title": "AirAsia, FGV, UEM Sunrise, IHH Healthcare, Sime Darby, Maybank, Telekom, YTL Corp, Pharmaniaga, Iris, Genting and Genting Malaysia", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 26): Based on corporate announcements and news flow today, the companies that may be in focus tomorrow (Friday, Nov 27) could include the following: AirAsia, FGV, UEM Sunrise, IHH Healthcare, Sime Darby, Maybank, Telekom, YTL Corp, Pharmaniaga, Iris, Genting and Genting Malaysia. Low-cost carrier AirAsia Bhd sank into the red in its third quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (3Q15) with a net loss of RM405.72 million, dragged down by a foreign exchange (forex) loss on borrowings and losses from the share of results of associates and jointly-controlled entities, as well as one-off costs related to the sale and leaseback of aircraft. Its forex loss came in at RM435.98 million, its filing to Bursa Malaysia today showed; it recorded a net profit of RM5.4 million in the previous year's corresponding period. Its latest quarterly revenue, however, was up 15% at RM1.52 billion from RM1.32 billion last year; the strong revenue growth was on the back of a remarkable 19% growth in the number of passengers carried at 6.29 million in the quarter, ahead of a 7% capacity growth, which allowed the group to record a high load factor of 82% \u2014 a five percentage point year-on-year (y-o-y) growth. Its 3Q quarterly loss, however, saw the group posting a net loss of RM13.37 million in the cumulative nine months ended Sept 30 (9MFY15), compared with a net profit of RM512.27 million in 9MFY14. This resulted in a 9MFY15 loss per share of 0.5 sen, versus an 18.4 sen earnings per share (EPS) registered in the same period last year. Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd (FGV) saw its third-quarter net loss widen more than three times to RM33.92 million or 0.9 sen loss per share from RM9.33 million or 0.3 sen loss per share a year ago, on lower contribution from its palm plantation and trading, marketing and logistics segments. This was despite posting a higher revenue of RM4.51 billion for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (3QFY15), up 13.8% from RM3.96 billion in 3QFY14. Nevertheless, the group declared an interim dividend of 2 sen per share for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2015 (FY15), equivalent to a total dividend payout of RM72.96 million, payable on Dec 28. The weaker 3QFY15 earnings dragged FGV's net profit down by 94.5% to RM15.74 million or 0.4 sen a share for the cumulative nine-month period (9MFY15) from RM286.16 million or 7.8 sen a share in 9MFY14. Revenue for 9MFY15 was marginally higher at RM11.41 billion compared with RM11.34 billion in 9MFY14. On its prospects, FGV said the environment remains challenging, with the slowdown in the Chinese economy, uncertain global financial markets and volatile forex rates. UEM Sunrise Bhd's net profit fell 33.2% to RM47.7 million for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (3QFY15) from RM71.5 million a year ago, on lower property development revenue, higher finance cost, and lower contribution from associates and joint ventures. Revenue for 3QFY15 declined 25.06% to RM353.06 million from RM471.14 million in 3QFY14, due to lower development revenue. For the nine-month period (9MFY15), UEM Sunrise's net profit declined almost 11% to RM184.79 million from RM207.54 million, while revenue was 13.64% lower at RM1.14 billion from RM1.32 billion. As at Sept 30, the group's unrecognised revenue has risen to RM4.1 billion from RM2.8 billion a year ago, which it said will continue to contribute towards the group's revenue and earnings for the year. IHH Healthcare Bhd's net profit dropped 19.34% in its third quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (3QFY15) to RM118.49 million or 1.44 sen per share, from RM146.91 million or 1.8 sen per share in the same period last year, due to unrealised forex losses. The leading premium healthcare provider said it recorded RM217.1 million exchange losses, with the translation of its non-Turkish Lira denominated borrowings by Acibadem Holdings during the quarter. Meanwhile, revenue for the quarter under review came in 15.73% higher at RM2.06 billion, from RM1.78 billion a year ago, underpinned by organic growth at its existing hospitals and the ramping up of three newer hospitals, namely Acibadem Atakent Hospital in Turkey, and Pantai Hospital Manjung and Gleneagles Kota Kinabalu in Malaysia. For the cumulative nine-month period (9MFY15), IHH's net profit inched up 0.6% to RM518.08 million or 6.31 sen per share from RM515.06 million or 6.31 sen per share due to the same reason, while revenue for the period gained 13.86% to RM6.16 billion from RM5.41 billion in 9MFY14. Meanwhile, IHH has announced that Low Soon Teck will be its new chief financial officer (CFO) from Jan 10, 2016. Low, 50, a Singaporean, will replace Tan See Haw, 59, who will be stepping down as CFO of the healthcare group on Jan 9 next year. Sime Darby Bhd recorded a 34% drop in net profit to RM328.39 million for the first quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (1QFY16) from RM500.69 million last year, on lower revenue from its mining equipment, and automotive units. Sime Darby said property and port operations revenue also fell while plantation top line rose during 1QFY16. Its 1QFY16 revenue increased marginally to RM10.17 billion from RM10.12 billion in 1QFY15. The world's largest listed palm oil producer is mulling a cash call to trim its gearing ratio to 40% from about 60% currently, said its president and group chief executive officer Tan Sri Mohd Bakke Salleh. Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) posted an 18% rise in net profit in its third quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (3QFY15) to RM1.9 billion from RM1.61 billion, as net interest and Islamic banking income grew. Higher net insurance premium also supported profit growth, despite significantly higher bad loan allowance, Maybank told Bursa today. Net profit for the nine-month period (9MFY15) climbed to RM5.18 billion from RM4.79 billion a year earlier, while net interest income rose 12.3% to RM8.2 billion from RM7.3 billion in 9MFY14. During 3QFY15, Maybank said net interest income rose to RM2.9 billion, while Islamic banking income climbed to RM1.08 billion. \"This (net interest and Islamic banking income growth) was largely due to the growth in the group's gross loans, advances and financing,\" Maybank said. Maybank said bad loan allowance rose to RM667.94 million, from RM70.54 million due to higher net collective allowance of RM341.1 million, and lower bad debts and financing recovered of RM196.4 million. Telekom Malaysia Bhd's (TM) net profit for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (3QFY15) fell 12% to RM166.87 million from RM188.85 million a year earlier, despite posting a higher revenue of RM2.92 billion versus RM2.64 billion in 3QFY14. For the nine months ended Sept 30 (9MFY15), TM's net profit dipped to RM507.85 million from RM613.51 million in 9MFY14, on revenue of RM8.54 billion versus RM8.08 billion a year earlier. TM told the stock exchange today that the lower net income was due to forex losses from borrowings and consolidation of operational losses from Packet One Networks (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd. YTL Corp Bhd's net profit dipped 6.3% to RM202.6 million in its first quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (1QFY16), compared with RM216.1 million in 1QFY15, as revenue came in lower and its hotels segment slipped into a pre-tax loss. It also recorded lower contributions from its IT and e-commerce related business, as well as its cement manufacturing and trading, property investment and development, and utilities segments, it told Bursa today. 1QFY15 revenue dropped 0.8% to RM4.44 billion from RM4.48 billion last year. Segmentally, its IT and e-commerce related business' profit before tax (PBT) was almost halved y-o-y to RM565,000, as its cement manufacturing and trading segment's PBT fell 7.7%, while its property investment and development segment's PBT shrank 37.1%. Its utilities segment's PBT slipped 9.6% y-o-y, while its hotels segment slipped into the red with a pre-tax loss of RM11.97 million, compared with a net profit of RM5.68 million. Pharmaniaga Bhd saw its net profit jump 33.5% in its third quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (3QFY15) to RM19.97 million or 7.71 sen per share from RM14.96 million or 5.78 sen per share a year ago, due to ongoing cost optimisation measures, which helped to reduce operating expenses. Revenue for 3QFY15 rose 4.4% to RM524.41 million from RM502.09 million in the previous year, due to improved contributions from the group's Indonesian operations. It declared a third interim dividend of 9 sen, payable on Dec 21, bringing cumulative dividend for the year to 23 sen. For the cumulative nine-month period (9MFY15), Pharmaniaga's net profit rose 19% to RM67.98 million or 26.26 sen per share, from RM57.15 million or 22.07 sen per share in 9MFY14, due to favourable profit margins from the manufacturing division as a result of continuous cost optimisation initiatives, which led to reduced manufacturing costs. Revenue for 9MFY15 inched up 0.67% to RM1.51 billion from RM1.5 billion in 9MFY14. Iris Corp Bhd has yesterday bagged a contract worth US$22 million (RM92.65 million) from the Government of Solomon Islands to establish the information and management system of electronic passport and border control. Iris told Bursa that it had entered into a build-own-transfer (BOT) agreement for a term of 20 years commencing from the date of the contract with the Government of Solomon Islands for the establishment of the electronic passport system. Under the BOT project financing model, Iris will build and own the information systems, software and hardware under the agreement during the term only. After the expiration of the term, ownership of the same will be transferred to the client (Government of Solomon Islands). Conglomerate group Genting Bhd's net profit for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (3QFY15) climbed 2.38% to RM361.09 million or 9.71 sen per share from RM352.7 million or 9.49 sen per share in the previous year. The better earnings was underpinned by higher adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), contributed mainly by higher net forex gains. A reversal of RM186.4 million in respect of previously recognised impairment losses, mainly in respect of the UK casino licences also contributed to the better net income although this was partially offset by higher net fair value loss on derivative financial instruments, impairment losses and deferred expenses written off in respect of the Bimini operations. 3QFY15's revenue was 3.56% higher at RM4.65 billion from RM4.49 billion underpinned by the better performance from its power segment. For the cumulative nine months (9MFY15), Genting recorded a 14.17% fall in net profit to RM1.05 billion or 28.22 sen per share from RM1.22 billion or 32.91 sen per share in 9MFY14. Revenue for the period also fell 3.02% to RM13.18 billion from RM13.59 billion a year ago. Meanwhile, its 49.06%-owned subsidiary Genting Malaysia Bhd's (GenM) net profit jumped 22.6% in 3QFY15 to RM326.29 million from RM266.12 million the previous year even though revenue fell 9% to RM2.03 billion from RM2.23 billion previously. The better net income was due to the absence of impairment losses during the quarter under review, lower pre-operating expenses offset by deferred expenses written off and higher depreciation and amortisation charges. The lower revenue was attributed to the 60% drop in turnover generated from its UK business to RM268.7 million in 3QFY15 from RM674.7 million in the previous year. For the nine-month period (9MFY15), GenM's net profit gained 4.6% to RM919.32 million or 16.22 sen per share from RM878.84 million or 15.5 sen per share a year earlier, while revenue slipped 1.13% to RM6.1 billion from RM6.17 billion in 9MFY14. Both of the groups did not declare dividend for the quarter under review.

We could do a rights issue, a share placement or monetise our assets. But ultimately, the decision is in shareholders' hands,\" he told reporters, after announcing Sime Darby's financial performance for the first financial quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (1QFY16). However, Bakke said there are no plans to spin off its units for now. \"We are ready to do a listing, but the regional markets \u2014 not just Malaysia's \u2014 are rather soft. So an IPO (initial public offering) is out for now.\" Sime Darby Motors Sdn Bhd, the group's automotive division, was supposed to go for listing this year. The division's sales contributed nearly half to the group's revenue in 1QFY16. Sime Darby's gearing level historically had been in the region of 0.3 times, but it was elevated recently to finance its purchase of New Britain Palm Oil Ltd (NBPOL). The exercise, completed in March, added over RM5 billion to its borrowings. Bakke also said the ringgit's depreciation against the US dollar resulted in its debt to increase more than RM1 billion. Sixty percent of its RM13.57 billion long-term borrowings are in US dollars. \"Some analysts are projecting that the ringgit will come down to as much as RM4 (to a dollar) next year. A strengthening ringgit will bring a marked reduction to our debt figure,\" he commented. Total borrowings amounted to RM19.73 billion or 0.62 times of Sime Darby's shareholders' funds of RM32.01 billion. But deducting RM4.04 billion of cash in hand, the group's net gearing level worked out to 0.49 times. As for Sime Darby's 1QFY16 performance, its net profit dropped by 34.4% year-on-year to RM328.4 million, as weak commodity prices brought a severe impact to its bottom line. Revenue however was up 0.5% to RM10.17 billion, indicating depressed profit margins, despite higher sales \u2014 especially after getting contribution from NBPOL. The average crude palm oil price in the quarter was RM2,088 per tonne, down 5% from last year, said Sime Darby. As at 4.50pm, Sime Darby (fundamental: 0.8; valuation: 1.4) shares were traded down one sen or 0.12% at RM8.06, with 3.81 million shares done. Its market capitalisation stood at RM50.62 billion.

In a statement to Bursa Malaysia today, Sime Darby said property and port operations revenue also fell. Plantation topline however rose during 1QY16, according to Sime Darby. Sime Darby said 1QFY16's RM328.39 million net profit compared against RM500.69 million. Revenue increased to RM10.17 billion, from RM10.12 billion. Sime Darby's president and group chief executive Tan Sri Mohd Bakke Salleh said the group had contended with a challenging business landscape, during the quarter. Mohd Bakke described the period under review as \"a difficult market environment faced across the divisions\" \"Weaker demand in consumer businesses and persistently low CPO and coal prices have impacted profitability. We will consistently deploy our capital and resources, in line with our long-term strategy for each of the business activities,\" Mohd Bakke said. Sime Darby's oil palm plantation unit had curbed the group's profit decline. Mohd Bakke said the plantation division achieved higher profit before interest and tax at RM312 million for the quarter, versus RM289.3 million. The growth was attributed to contribution from Malaysia and New Britain Palm Oil Limited (NBPOL) operations, besides realised exchange gain of RM45.4 million.

JUDGING from the initial euphoria over Johor Corp Bhd\u2019s offer to privatise its plantation arm, Kulim (M) Bhd, the exercise should get the nod from shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting slated to be convened later. Last Friday, Kulim\u2019s shares gained 57 sen, or 17.3%, to close at RM3.87, which marks its highest close since the late 1980s. \u00a0Kulim\u2019s warrants surged 29.5 sen to close at RM1 last Friday. \u00a0\u00a0 To recap, Johor Corp (JCorp), Johor\u2019s investment arm, and parties acting in concert are looking to privatise Kulim (fundamental: 2.60; valuation: 3) via a selective capital reduction and repayment exercise of RM4.10 per share. The proposed selective capital reduction is also extended to holders of Kulim\u2019s warrants and individuals in employee share option schemes who converted their warrants and options into shares prior to the entitlement period.\u00a0 According to Kulim\u2019s annual report, as at mid-April this year, there were 76.3 million warrants that had yet to be converted from the 156.2 million issued at end-February 2011. The warrants initially had a strike price of RM3.13, but this was later adjusted to RM2.77 after Kulim paid a special dividend of 37.6 sen. The warrants mature at end-February next year. \u00a0 To succeed, the privatisation exercise requires the approval of 50% of shareholders in number and 75% in value of the votes, and must not be rejected by more than 10% in value of the votes. Considering Kulim\u2019s share base is about 1.2 billion and JCorp has about 755.2 million shares, it would have to fork out RM1.9 billion to buy the shares it does not own,\u00a0excluding the warrants. As at mid-April this year, JCorp had almost 21.3 million warrants or close to 27.9% of the derivatives issued. The number of warrants JCorp holds now is not clear.  Judging by comments from analysts and other market watchers, the deal seems to be a good one for Kulim\u2019s minority shareholders. For starters, considering Kulim\u2019s net assets per share as at end-June this year stood at RM3.74, the offer seems to be an attractive one. It is also noteworthy that JCorp and parties acting in concert hold 755.2 million shares or almost 61.9% of Kulim and as at mid-April this year, Kulim had only one substantial shareholder other than JCorp, namely Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) (KWAP), with 6.8% equity interest.\u00a0 To put things in perspective, KWAP surfaced as a substantial shareholder in Kulim in mid-April this year, when the stock was trading at an average of RM2.65, which makes it unlikely that the pension fund will create a fuss over the RM4.10 price tag per Kulim share. \u00a0\u00a0 Also, a market watcher points out that the offer comes at a time when crude palm oil (CPO) prices are depressed, and there is much uncertainty in the market. Last Friday, CPO futures traded at RM2,380 per tonne, down some 40% from just below RM4,000 per tonne in February 2011. \u201cWhile CPO prices have been picking up, there is still considerable uncertainty \u2026 so minority shareholders of Kulim may want to lock in this profit,\u201d he says. RHB Research Institute says JCorp\u2019s \u201cattempt [to privatise Kulim] is likely to succeed, given that Kulim\u2019s share price would unlikely reach that level (RM4.10) otherwise. We view the privatisation offer price as generous, being 9.6% above [RHB Research\u2019s] target price [of RM3.74] and factoring in the second tranche of its special dividend from the sale of New Britain Palm Oil Ltd [NBPOL]\u201d. Excluding the dividend, the offer is 24% above its last closing price. While RHB Research cites catalysts for Kulim\u2019s share price and \u201cpotential value boosters\u201d to include a potentially valuable oil find in its oil exploration venture, steady improvement in its palm oil yield, given that its age profile is now at its best ever and even Microsoft setting up operations in Sedenak, Johor, where Kulim has 4,554ha of land, it goes on to say that \u201cnone of these are likely to push Kulim\u2019s stock price to RM4.10 over the next 12 months\u201d. Another stand-alone brokerage sees \u201cthe privatisation exercise as a huge windfall for minority shareholders\u201d. For its first six months ended June, Kulim registered a net profit of almost RM1.4 billion on revenue of \u00a0RM779.6 million. In its announcements, Kulim said it recorded a gain on disposal of some RM1.3 billion from sales, including that of NBPOL to Sime Darby Bhd. As at end-June, Kulim had cash and cash equivalents of RM1.7 billion, and on the other side of the balance sheet, the plantation company had short-term borrowings of RM606.8 million and long-term debt commitments of RM235.2 million. \u00a0 To recap, in October 2014, plantation giant Sime Darby made a cash offer of \u00a37.15 per share for all shares in NBPOL and completed the RM6 billion deal at end-February this year, with Kulim receiving \u00a3525.4 million, or over RM2.7 billion, from the disposal of its stake in NBPOL. Thus, it is likely that much of the funds for the selected capital repayment are from Sime Darby. \u00a0 Despite the jump in Kulim\u2019s share price, those left out of the euphoria still stand to gain 5% if they jump on the bandwagon, based on its closing price of RM3.87 last Friday."}, "173": {"date_posted": "24/11/2015", "title": "Over 5% of E&O shares, 40 million E&O-WB change hands off-market", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 24): A total of 65.27 million Eastern & Oriental Bhd's (E&O) shares, which made up 5.21% of the Penang-based property developer's share base, were traded off-market today at RM1.57 apiece.

Ho Hup Construction Company Bhd clinched a RM21.6 million subcontract for soil improvement work at the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) project in Pengerang, Johor. In a filing with Bursa, Ho Hup said today that the company was awarded the contract by Sinopec Engineering Group (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (SEGM), the main contractor of PRPC Refinery and Cracker Sdn Bhd, via a letter of award dated Sept 23, 2015. SEGM is a subsidiary of Sinopec Group, the leading oil refining, petrochemical and chemical engineering group based in China. The job is expected to commence next month and will be completed over four months. The company said the contract is in the best interest of the company after considering the potential financial contribution to the earnings of the company, amongst others. \u201cThis maiden contract in Petronas\u2019 RAPID project will put the group in a good and competitive position for other infrastructure and construction projects we have tendered for in Pengerang, Johor,\u201d said Ho Hup chief executive Derek Wong Kit Leong in a separate statement. Asdion Bhd announced that Tengku Azlan Ibni Sultan Abu Bakar, Datuk Yen Soon Ai and Datuk Mohamed Ridzuan Nor MD resigned last Saturday. In its Bursa filings today, the computer software specialist said former chairman Tengku Azlan, and the two former executive directors Yen and Mohamed Ridzuan did not give reasons for their resignations.\nThey were supposed to stand for re-election today at Asdion\u2019s annual general meeting. Their resignations followed a recent announcement on Asdion\u2019s higher audited net loss for financial year ended March 31, 2015 (FY15) compared to the unaudited figures. Asdion told the exchange on Sept 1 this year its FY15 audited net loss was RM2.81 million versus the unaudited net loss of RM2.07 million.\n\u201cThe deviation is mainly due to wrong calculation of the non-controlling interests for newly acquired subsidiary,\u201d Asdion said then. MMC Corp Bhd's wholly-owned subsidiary, Senai Airport City Sdn Bhd (SACSB), has leased 24.75 acres of its industrial land to Japanese food products supplier Fuji Oil Asia Pte Ltd, for RM53.9 million.\nFuji Oil Asia, which is part of the Fuji Oil Group, entered into a lease agreement with SACSB for 60 years to construct and operate its manufacturing facility, said MMC Corp in a statement today. Headquartered in Japan, Fuji Oil Asia is a global supplier of intermediate food ingredients, particularly specialty oils and fats, confectionery and bakery, soy protein and its related consumer food products. The facility will be its largest outside Japan and is located adjacent to its major client: US-based confectionary Hershey\u2019s largest chocolate manufacturing facility outside of North America. SACSB is the master developer of the 2,718 acre integrated industrial development known as Senai Airport City, with various industrial segments such as free industrial zone, hi-tech and general manufacturing, aerospace maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) as well as logistics and mixed development, which are currently being developed in phases with 40% completed to date. According to the statement, MMC Corp is leveraging to capitalise on the sale and/or lease of its strategic property assets in Johor, comprising almost 5,000 acres of industrial land in both Senai Airport City and the Tanjung Bin Petrochemical & Maritime Industry Centre developments. It is also looking to unlock the values of almost 500 acres of pockets of lands and buildings mainly in the central and northern states to support its revenue growth in the next five years. Consumer product manufacturer Takaso Resources Bhd\u2019s net loss widened to RM4.88 million for its fourth quarter ended July 31, 2015 (4QFY15) from RM3.01 million in 4QFY14. On a cumulative full year basis, its annual net losses for the financial year ended July 31, 2015 widened to RM7.99 million from RM5.95 million in the previous year. \"The increase was mainly due to additional impairment loss on plant and machinery of RM1.5 million and impairment loss on receivables of RM820,000 during the current quarter and cumulative period under review compared with the corresponding quarter and cumulative period ended 31 July 2014,\" said Takaso in a filing with Bursa today. Revenue contracted 20% to RM6.35 million from RM7.94 million previously due to the slowdown in its computer accessories business. Full year revenue was weaker at RM36.76 million, down 2.1% from RM37.56 million a year ago. The lower revenue was caused by a slowdown in cathode ray tube glass business and trading in consumable products despite improvements in its electrical and mechanical products and computer accessories segment. \u00a0 The company has been facing challenges in its core business of manufacturing and marketing of condoms and baby products as raw material prices and operational cost rose over the last few years. Bursa Malaysia will proceed to delist Practice Note 17 company Octagon Consolidated Bhd from its Official List of Securities tomorrow, despite the company's appeal. In its filing with Bursa today, Octagon said that Bursa has informed the company that the decision of its listing committee is final, and reiterated that the securities of the company will be removed from the official list of Bursa Securities tomorrow.\nOctagon submitted a letter of appeal to Bursa Malaysia last Friday, appealing against its delisting and seeking approval from the regulator for an extension of time, up to 60 days, from the date of the letter of appeal to submit its proposed regularisation plan. Trading in the securities of Octagon was suspended on Nov 27, 2013. It last traded at seven sen for a market capitalisation of RM11.7 million. Aluminum billets manufacturer A-Rank Bhd saw its net profit for the fourth quarter ended July 31, 2015 (4QFY15) climbed 32.8% to RM3.98 million from RM2.99 million a year ago, due to the overprovision of deferred taxation in prior years.\nEarnings per share expanded to 3.31 sen from 2.49 sen. However, A-Rank announced to Bursa today that its revenue for the quarter fell 6.4% to RM115.48 million from RM123.35 million in the same corresponding period.\nThe company explained the decline in revenue was due to lower business volume although average selling prices were higher as a result of the increase in raw material cost. A-Rank has proposed a first and final single-tier dividend of 2.25 sen per share, amounting to RM2.7 million, for FY15. For FY15, A-Rank's net profit rose 8.63% to RM10.32 million, or 8.6 sen per share, against RM9.5 million, or 7.92 sen per share, a year earlier.\nRevenue was almost flat at RM485.95 million compared with RM487.3 million in FY14. A-Rank said the volatility of aluminium prices and weak ringgit has had adverse impacts on its profit margins and the increase in natural gas pricing from July 1 has also added further pressure to margins. Barring unforeseen circumstances, the company said it is \"optimistic\" to remain profitable for the forthcoming quarter. Tadmax Resources Bhd is divesting its entire stake in wholly-owned Usama Industries Sdn Bhd to individuals Phua Bok Chuan and Nai Kin Nai Chooi for RM1.99 million. Tadmax entered into a share sale agreement for the proposed divestment aimed at realising the net assets value of an inactive entity. Property developer Tadmax added that the proceeds from the sale will be channelled to working capital purposes, including overhead expenditure.\nIt does not expect the sale to have any material impact on the company\u2019s earnings and net assets for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2015. Usama Industries\u2019 primary activity was the extraction and trading of timber logs, but the company has been dormant since July 2010 after the expiration of its timber concession in Kapit, Sarawak. Tadmax\u2019s original cost of investment in Usama Industries was RM200,000 in August 1993. The original cost of investment was reduced by RM100.08 million following the payment of dividend out of pre-acquisition profits during the financial year ended Dec 31, 2005. Abu Dhabi state fund Aabar Investments may refuse to invest in a RM2.5 billion (US$565 million) rights issue by RHB Capital, Reuters reported. RHB announced the rights issue in April to support its growth and meet regulatory requirements for capital. Aabar owns about 21.09% of the bank group. But three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters in the last few days that Aabar was unlikely to buy into the offer partly because it was disappointed by the performance of its investment in RHB as Malaysia\u2019s currency and financial markets sag. A Malaysian investment banker who requested anonymity said Aabar was not happy with their RHB investment and will not subscribe. Penang-based Pentamaster Corp Bhd is proposing to acquire Origo Ventures (M) Sdn Bhd, a property project management company for RM5.78 million.\nIn its Bursa filing today, Pentamaster said that it entered into a sale and purchase agreement to acquire two ordinary shares, representing a 100% stake in Origo from Sulaiman Ahmad and Sabariah Ahmad. \u201cOrigo is headed by an experienced general manager that has more than 14 years of architecture and property project management experience that span across major Malaysian property companies, namely Sunway Bhd, TRC Development Sdn Bhd, Talam Corporation Bhd and IOI Properties Bhd,\" said the global manufacturing industries automation solutions provider. On April 15, Origo was contracted by by Maarij Development Sdn Bhd to project manage a mixed development project measuring about 9.88 acres in the new township of Tunjong, Jajahan Kota Bharu, Kelantan. The gross development value is approximately RM164 million, and the total remuneration for the project management agreement shall equate to 60% of the net profit generated from the development. To date, Origo has an outstanding billing of approximately RM3 million to Maarij, upon the completion of stages of work done. The proposed acquisition is expected to be financed through Pentamaster's internally generated funds. Upon the completion of the proposed acquisition, the group also stands to gain financially from Origo's existing contract, it said. Muar Ban Lee Group Bhd's (MBL) wholly-owned unit Muar Ban Lee Engineering Sdn Bhd (MBLE) is subscribing to a 51% stake in PT Serdang Jaya Perdana (SJP), which is IDR 15.3 billion or RM4.57 million, to venture into the upstream industry of palm kernel oil processing and manufacturing. In a Bursa filing today, MBL said that MBLE today subscribed to a new additional allotment of IDR 15.3 billion paid up share capital in SJP at par value, equivalent to 51% shareholdings, to be satisfied in cash generated internally. Pursuant to the subscription, SJP will become a subsidiary of MBLE. The purchase was arrived on a willing buyer-willing seller basis after taking into consideration the audited consolidated net assets of SJP as at Dec 31, 2014 and the potential earnings of SJP. The subscription will be completed within 60 days. MBLE is principally involved in manufacturing and trading in all kinds of machinery, tools, plants, hardware, building materials, accessories and engineering requisites, while SJP operates a palm kernel crushing plant where crude palm kernel oil is extracted from palm kernel. Gamuda Bhd's net profit declined 25.4% to RM153.68 million in the fourth quarter ended July 31, 2015 (4QFY15) from RM205.89 million a year ago, mainly due to the completion of the electrified-double tracking railway. In the filing to Bursa filing, the construction company said its revenue rose 5.28% to RM623.27 million from RM592 million a year ago. The earnings per share (EPS) was 6.39 sen versus 8.89 sen.\nFor the full year of FY15, Gamuda's net profit fell 5.2% to RM682.1 million from RM719.4 million. Annual EPS decreased to 28.94 sen from 31.29 sen.\nRevenue was at RM2.4 billion, a slight increase of 7.62% compared with RM2.23 billion in FY14. Gamuda attributed the increase in revenue to higher contribution from Kesas Sdn Bhd as a result of the additional stake in the concessionaire of Shah Alam Expressway. Moving forward, the group anticipates a good performance next calendar year from ongoing construction projects and steady earnings from the water and expressway concessions division. \"However, with the softening residential and non-residential property market, weaker growth for the property division is expected over the coming quarters,\" it added. Gamuda's share price has fallen from a peak of RM5.15 in May to a 28-month low of RM3.85 last month. Lembaga Tabung Haji (LTH) has raised its stake in Cypark Resources Bhd to 10.17%, from 8.52%, after purchasing four million shares over a four-day trading period last week. In its Bursa Malaysia announcement today, Cypark Resources said LTH bought total of four million shares between Sept 21 and Sept 25. The transaction price is not revealed.\u00a0 This raised LTH\u2019s total shares in Cypark Resources to 24.58 million shares. Year-to-date, the share price of Cypark Resources, which provides integrated environmental engineering services such as landfill restoration and waste water management treatment, has dropped by 21.4% or 46 sen. Property developer Eastern & Oriental Bhd (E&O) said today the construction of the infrastructure at the 54.63ha freehold land in Elmina West will be carried out over the next three years. In a filing to Bursa, the company said the full payment of RM192.75 million for the parcel of land acquired from Sime Darby Elmina Development Sdn Bhd, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Sime Darby Bhd, was completed today. E&O said Sime Darby Elmina Development will continue the construction work on the land, while instalment payments are settled. According to the sale and purchase agreement, E&O had said 90% the construction sum of RM47.04 million will be paid in equal quarterly instalments, over the construction period.

Affin Hwang Investment Bank Bhd said it maintained its crude palm oil (CPO) average selling price assumption of RM2,150 per metric tonne (MT) for 2015 and a 12% increase to RM2,400/MT for 2016 to 2017. \u201cWe see a number of positives, including a strengthening El Ni\u00f1o impacting 2016E-17E production, price stabilisation measures to be announced and pickup in global economic growth in 2016-17E. \u201cWe maintain our sector \u2018neutral\u2019 rating and continue to advise investors to look for trading opportunities on market weakness,\u201d it said in a note.

Douglas was reported as saying that the scheme would reduce CPO production by 250,000 tonnes, which would help stabilise palm oil prices which hit lows of RM1,802 per tonne on Aug 27. \u201cThis represents about 1% of the country\u2019s 2014 total CPO output and 10% of the palm oil inventory as at end-Aug 15. We expect this news to be mildly positive for CPO prices in the medium term,\u201d Ng said.

However, planters like Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd (FGV) and Sime Darby Bhd with larger areas to replant (of around 10,000ha to 15,000ha per annum) could stand to benefit more in absolute terms. \u201cThis means the incentives scheme could potentially reduce Sime Darby\u2019s and FGV\u2019s costs by RM10 million to RM22.5 million per annum. \u201cOther beneficiaries within our coverage are IOI Corp Bhd, Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd, Hap Seng Plantations Holdings Bhd and Genting Plantations Bhd,\u201d she said.

The conglomerate is committed to strengthening its balance sheet \u2014 which saw net gearing balloon to 58% from 38% after the acquisition of New Britain Palm Oil Ltd (NBPOL) in March \u2014 but has no concrete plans yet on how it will do it. \u201cWe have not come up with a plan yet, it is still a work in progress. But definitely, we are working on strengthening our balance sheet,\u201d Tan Sri Mohd Bakke Salleh, Sime Darby\u2019s president and group chief executive, said at a press briefing after the release of its quarterly financial results last Wednesday. \u201cThe intention is to come up with a gearing ratio that is a bit more palatable for ourselves and our stakeholders. If we can bring it to anywhere between 30% and 35%, that would be a lot more desirable,\u201d Bakke remarked. But he also noted that given the cheaper cost of debt compared to equity, it makes sense to borrow at this point in time. Bakke added that Sime Darby (fundamental: 0.80; valuation: 1.40) would also consider merger and acquisition opportunities to expand its footprint. \u201cEverything we are encountering today is not all doom and gloom.

There has been market talk recently that the group is considering a RM6 billion rights issue to pare down its debts, but Sime Darby has not confirmed or denied this.

Unless Sime Darby can immediately buy something that is earnings accretive, would shareholders want to fork out the extra cash?\u201d asks CIMB Research\u2019s regional analyst Ivy Ng. \u201cIt does not seem critical for it to buy more assets at this point. But if the offers coming to it look increasingly interesting, then the rights issue might be an option to consider if it offsets the dilution effect,\u201d she says. In that vein, others point out that Sime Darby will have to hold off any major acquisitions until it has reduced its debt level. \u201cIt is highly likely that until it deleverages sufficiently, it might not do another acquisition, or do a combination of debt and equity to maintain gearing at current levels, or even bring down debt,\u201d Fitch Ratings\u2019 director of corporate ratings Nandini Vijayaraghavan tells digitaledge Weekly. \u201cSime Darby historically is always looking for M&A, but it is careful and most [of the] acquisitions it has made have been value accretive,\u201d she adds. In March, Fitch Ratings downgraded Sime Darby\u2019s outlook to \u201cnegative\u201d after imputing debts from the NBPOL buy. Sime Darby\u2019s FFO (funds from operations)-adjusted net leverage has risen to 2.5 times, well above the 1.75 times level at which Fitch would consider negative rating action. Interestingly, one analyst notes that Sime Darby\u2019s current gearing level is not untowardly high. \u201cThe negative rating by Fitch is the bigger concern because that will impact Sime Darby\u2019s cost of borrowing,\u201d he says. Bakke had said at the briefing, \u201cWe need to respond to what credit rating agencies are looking for.\u201d According to Alliance Research, Sime Darby\u2019s borrowing cost is currently 3.4% per annum. That said, Sime Darby may not have to actively borrow more or make a cash call if business operations improve and cash flow rises. As at June30, Sime Darby had cash of RM3.65 billion, giving it a net debt of RM14.4 billion. But earnings have taken a hit for FY2015 with net profit falling 31.3% year on year to RM2.3 million on flat revenue of RM43.7 million. Profit before interest and tax from its biggest income earner, the plantation division, fell 39% y-o-y to RM1.15 billion as average crude palm oil (CPO) prices dropped 11% to RM2,193 per tonne. Its fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production for the year also fell 5% to nine million tonnes. Quarterly net profit slipped 17% to RM988.67 million for the fourth financial quarter ended June 30 (4QFY2015), from RM1.19 billion in the previous corresponding period. Revenue was marginally higher at RM12.86 billion against RM12.56 billion previously. The board has declared a lower dividend of 19 sen per share for 4QFY2015, bringing the total annual dividend to 25 sen per share for FY2015, compared with 30 sen in the previous corresponding quarter and 36 sen for FY2014. The difficult operating environment has prompted many analysts to cut their target price: Alliance Research to RM7.40, CIMB Research to RM8.08, AffinHwang Capital Research to RM7.59 and AmResearch to RM8. \u201cIf CPO prices start to perk up or cash flow from its businesses starts to improve, then leverage is likely to moderate and they might not need to take on any major fundraising, but it is still too early to tell at this juncture,\u201d says Fitch\u2019s Nandini. In an Aug 27 note, she writes, \u201cRobust CPO and other vegetable oils output will continue to pressurise the CPO price in the short to medium term. An El NiNo is expected to occur in 2H15, while the resultant adverse impact on FFB yield and output will not be immediate. \u201cCPO prices are still at a level sufficient for the large players to cover their costs and generate adequate operating cash flow. The credit profiles of even the large CPO operators would deteriorate should prices stagnate at the current levels or decline further.\u201d Spot CPO prices fell as low as about RM1,860 per tonne in the middle of last week, over 9% lower than in the week before, according to data by the Malaysian Palm Oil Council. Spot CPO closed at RM1,994 last Friday while the benchmark three-month futures ended the week at RM1,802. Sime Darby is bearish on the CPO price, forecasting the commodity to trade between RM1,900 and RM2,000 per tonne up to end-September. \u201cBeyond that, it\u2019s difficult to predict because of the uncertain outlook,\u201d said Bakke. The group\u2019s silver lining would be the added earnings from NBPOL, which has already begun contributing to the group. For FY2015, it has raked in RM102.6 million in profit before interest and tax. NBPOL\u2019s palm trees are about 10 years and have brought Sime Darby\u2019s average tree profile down to 14 years. One analyst says that given its fairly young age profile, Sime Darby is in a fairly good position to weather low CPO prices. In the meantime, apart from more borrowings or a rights issue, Sime Darby is also considering unlocking value by divesting some non-core assets \u2014 a strategy it has had in place for some time now. Analysts concur that monetising assets such as land parcels and its 30% stake in Tesco is the best option for now. In FY2015, Sime Darby said that Tesco was the main contributor in its \u201cOthers\u201d division, making a loss before interest and tax of RM35.8 million compared with a RM52.7 million profit the year before. This was due to a one-off impairment on property, plant and equipment and stocks, in which Sime Darby\u2019s share was RM89.2 million. Most recently, Sime Darby sold off its 50% interest in Sime Darby Sunsuria Development Sdn Bhd for RM173.4 million and a 9.9% stake in Eastern & Oriental Bhd for a total of RM319 million. But the difficulty in the current weak market would be finding a buyer, and Sime Darby has been burnt before. The group, which distributes BMW, Hyundai and Ford cars, has put on hold indefinitely the planned listing of its motor division that was initially slated for 2HFY2015. The initial public offering had been estimated to raise some RM2 billion but is now deferred \u201cuntil the market is conducive for the exercise.\u201d In FY2015, the motor division\u2019s profit before interest and tax fell 25% y-o-y to RM473.6 million on lower earnings in all regions except for Australia, New Zealand and Vietnam. Sime Darby said that the division\u2019s sales in Malaysia were affected by tighter lending rules, the Goods and Services Tax, and the depreciating ringgit. \u00a0 \u00a0 Note: The Edge Research\u2019s fundamental score reflects a company\u2019s profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers.

This hastened the perception that the US Federal Reserve may be on its interest rate hike cycle in September 2015. The US markets rose initially, sparked by large gains in China and Japan. However, markets turned south after the jobs data emerged. The SP 500 Index tumbled 27.37 points to 1,942.04 points whilst the Dow plunged 239.11 points to end at 16,235.57.\u00a0 In Malaysia, the FBM KLCI Index moved in a narrower range of 46.11 points for the week with higher volumes of 1.68 billion shares to 2.56 billion shares traded. The index closed at 1,614.02 yesterday, up 10.66 points from the previous day as blue chip stocks like British American Tobacco (M) Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Genting Bhd, Genting Malaysia Bhd, and RHB Capital Bhd caused the index to rise on some rebound buying activities. The ringgit was weaker against the US dollar at 4.3170 as Brent crude oil inched up to US$47.20 (RM205.17) per barrel.\u00a0 The index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (Oct 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (July 2014), and it represents an extended Elliott Wave \u201cFlat\u201d rebound in a \u201cPseudo-Bull\u201d rise completed. The next few months\u2019 index price movements since July 2014 comprised key swings of 1,837.28 (low), 1,879.62 (high), 1,766.22 (low), 1,858.09 (high), 1,671.82 (low), 1,810.21 (high), 1,706.18 (low), 1,831.41 (high), 1,774.30 (low), 1,867.53 (high), 1,685.03 (low), 1,744.19 (high), 1,503.68 (low) and 1,660.22 (high). The index\u2019s daily signals have turned slightly mixed, with its DMI and Oscillator indicators showing negative signals but the CCI, MACD and Stochastic are positive. As such, the index\u2019s support levels are seen at the 1,503, 1,567 and 1,614 levels, while very heavy selling at the resistance areas of 1,620, 1,660 and 1,685 will cap any index rebound. The medium-term downside targets for the index may still remain at 1,448 and 1,414. The FBM KLCI\u2019s 18-day and 40-day simple moving averages (SMA) depict a mild sideways trend for its short-term daily chart whilst the 50-day and 200-day SMA have intersected with a \u201cDeath Cross\u201d as well. Therefore, this will not augur well for the index in the medium to longer term.\u00a0 Furthermore, the FBM KLCI had broken a very critical \u201cNeckline\u201d support of a major \u201cHead and Shoulder\u201d pattern on Aug 10, 2015. The implied target of such a breakdown pitches the medium-term downside target at 1,448 despite its current minor rebound phase that began on Aug 25, 2015 from the 1,503.68 low. Due to the volatile tone for the FBM KLCI Index, we are recommending a chart \u201csell\u201d on Sime Darby Bhd. A check on the Bloomberg consensus reveals that 26 research houses cover the stock, with three \u201cbuy\u201d calls, 17 \u201chold\u201d calls and six \u201csell\u201d calls.\u00a0 Maybank Investment Bank Bhd\u2019s analyst has a \u201chold\u201d call on Sime Darby despite its 4QFY6/15 core net profit of RM1 billion coming out above expectations at 114% of his forecast. The FY6/15 results were weaker year-on-year due to weaker crude palm oil average selling prices and lower fresh fruit bunches output, declining Australasia industrial contributions as well as margin compression from its Malaysia, Hong Kong and China motors segment. \u00a0He maintained Sime Darby\u2019s target price at RM7.98, based on 18 times financial year 2017 price-earnings ratio. Sime Darby currently trades at a high historical PER of 19.1 times. Its price-to-book value ratio of 1.47 times indicates that its share price is trading at a minor premium to its book value. Sime Darby\u2019s chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly down. Its share price made an obvious plunge since its major weekly Wave-5 high of RM9.60 in January 2015. Since that RM9.60 high, Sime Darby has tumbled to its August 2015 recent low of RM6.70. As prices broke above its recent key critical support levels of RM7.95 and RM8.26, look to \u201csell\u201d Sime Darby on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to medium-term downtrend for this stock.\u00a0 The daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the CCI, DMI, MACD and Oscillator) have issued clear sell signals and now depict firm indications of Sime Darby\u2019s eventual plunge towards lower levels. It would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of RM7.19, RM7.95 and RM8.26. We expect Sime Darby to witness weaker buying at its support areas of RM6.07, RM6.70 and RM7.15. Its downside targets are located at RM6.65, RM6.04 and RM4.99.   Lee Cheng Hooi is the regional chartist at Maybank Kim Eng.

An analyst with BIMB Securities Bhd attributed the decrease in the palm oil related stocks to the upcoming release of MPOB data, which is expected to be out this week, that may indicate lower exports as a result of weak global demand for palm oil. \u201cAnother factor that has brought about the weak sentiment in palm oil related counters is India, which has plans to spend US$1.5 billion in the next three years to help its farmers grow palm oil, which seems like a threat to Malaysia and Indonesia, considering India is one of the main importers of palm oil,\u201d said the analyst.

The sukuk was issued by Sime Darby's wholly-owned subsidiary Sime Darby Global Bhd. In a statement yesterday, the international rating agency said the negative outlook reflects the downgrade risk to Sime Darby's ratings if substantial debt reduction fails to materialise in the next six months such that adjusted debt/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) remains above 2.5 times. \u201cThe rating is unlikely to be upgraded or the outlook restored to stable even with a large reduction in debt levels given the current environment for its key businesses, although overt and substantial government support would be viewed favourably,\u201d said Moody\u2019s. \u201cNevertheless, higher crude palm oil (CPO) prices resulting in much greater cash generation coupled with an improved debt maturity profile could support a stable outlook,\u201d it added. Despite the broad spread of its business interests, Sime Darby has been impacted across the board by the slower rate of growth in China and most Asia-Pacific economies combined with lower commodity prices and a weaker domestic currency. This has seen leverage surge to over 4 times for the financial year ended June 30, 2015 (FY15) from 1.5 times for FY12. Moody\u2019s warned that the A3 rating is not sustainable at 4 times leverage, but Sime Darby had indicated that over the next six to nine months gearing - as measured by debt/equity - could fall to 35%-40% from 58% currently. \u201cOn that basis, and given the group's long track record, the rating action has been limited to a negative outlook at this time,\u201d said Moody's vice-president and senior credit officer Alan Greene in the statement. \u201cHowever, failure to deliver on the de-gearing within six months could lead to further erosion in Sime Darby's ratings,\" he added. In FY15 Sime Darby achieved an ebitda of RM4.5 billion from RM5.5 billion in FY14, reflecting declining CPO prices and a sharp fall in its industrial segment's contribution.\nDuring this time, reported gross debt climbed to RM18.2 billion from RM11.3 billion even as free cash balances declined by RM700 million. The rise in debt was largely driven by the RM6.9 billion acquisition of New Britain Palm Oil Ltd and its debt, where the price paid was full with respect to current CPO prices and the ringgit/pounds exchange rate. \"While management has pared back investment, sold several non-core assets and relied heavily on its property business to contribute cash andprofits, based on the outlook for motors and industrial, and given current CPO prices, ebitda or FFO are insufficient on their own to reduce leverage in a timely manner,\" said Greene. Sime Darby's largest single shareholder is Permodalan Nasional Bhd,with a 52% stake. \"While Sime Darby is widely viewed as a government-linked company, Moody's regards Sime Darby as a relatively independent business, albeit with a supportive shareholder. No formal uplift is incorporated into the current rating,\" said Greene. Sime Darby shares closed nine sen or 1.18% lower at RM7.55 yesterday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM47.45 billion.

Given the volatile external environment, some investors are likely to have locked in some of those gains \u2013 which possibly caused the recent correction. But more importantly, is the dip a window for those who missed out on the IPO to pick up the shares? Berjaya Auto director Datuk Francis Lee Kok Chuan opines that at the present level, it is a \u201cgood price\u201d for investors to buy into the company, which assembles and distributes Mazda vehicles in Malaysia.  \u201cOur shares are undervalued. Normally, a PER (price-earnings ratio) of 13 to 14 times is quite decent for auto stocks. As a growing company, we should be valued at a higher PER, but obviously, the market disagrees,\u201d he tells digitaledge Weekly. At its RM2.36 close on Aug 13, Berjaya Auto (fundamental: NA; valuation: NA) was trading at a PER of 12.4 times. In comparison, Tan Chong Motor Holdings Bhd (fundamental: 0.55; valuation: 1.40), which assembles vehicles for Nissan Motor Co, is trading at 15.8 times earnings. UMW Holdings Bhd (fundamental: 1.80; valuation: 1.40), the largest shareholder of Perusahaan Otomobil Kedua Sdn Bhd (Perodua) and distributor of Toyota vehicles, is trading at 17 times PER. All the seven research analysts who track Berjaya Auto have a \u201cbuy\u201d call on it, with target prices ranging from RM3 to RM3.50. In other words, they reckon the counter still has 27% to 48% upside potential. The two-for-five bonus issue, which was completed in June, is also expected to boost the stock\u2019s liquidity. In the light of the current poor market sentiment, Lee acknowledges that it will be difficult for Berjaya Auto shares to perform well in the near future. \u201cEverybody is panicky in the market. They just don\u2019t care and dump shares,\u201d he says. The 55-year-old, who was appointed to the board of Berjaya Auto in 2011, is also CEO of Berjaya Food Bhd (fundamental: 1.75; valuation: 2.10) and a director of High-5 Conglomerate Bhd. Currently, prominent businessman Tan Sri Vincent Tan Chee Yioun\u2019s Berjaya Corp Bhd (fundamental: 0.90; valuation: 2) is the single largest shareholder of Berjaya Auto, with a 34.28% stake. Berjaya Auto CEO Datuk Seri Ben Yeoh Choon San has a 6.49% stake while the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) has 6.08%. Interestingly, Berjaya Auto and Tan Chong Motor\u2019s stocks have performed conversely in the past 52 weeks, with the former advancing 34% from a year ago and the latter falling 50%. But it is also worth noting that Berjaya Auto\u2019s market capitalisation is now 1.6 times that of Tan Chong, although Nissan car sales volume was 3.5 times that of Mazda last year. At an initial public offering (IPO) price of 70 sen apiece, Berjaya Auto was listed on Bursa Malaysia in November 2013. Since then, its market capitalisation has grown from RM560 million to RM2.69 billion. Meanwhile, the group\u2019s net profit increased from RM50.86 million in the financial year ended April 30, 2013 (FY2013) to RM215.41 million in FY2015. Revenue grew from RM1.06 billion to RM1.83 billion. Lee believes the group has the right formula to sell cars to the younger generation. \u201cThere is a growing number of Mazda cars in the Malaysian market now. We want to attract a new generation of buyers, the premium customers. Youngsters today are different. They want a stylish car with the latest technology,\u201d he comments. Berjaya Auto aims to grow its Malaysian sales by 20% per annum in the next three years, says Lee. The group expects to register a profit growth of 10% in FY2016 on the back of 20% revenue growth. Lee adds that Berjaya Auto plans to sell 16,000 Mazda vehicles in Malaysia in FY2016, compared with 12,209 units sold in FY2015. The higher sales will be driven by the all-new Mazda 2 completely built-up (CBU) model imported from Thailand, as well as the Mazda 3 and CX-5, which are completely knocked-down (CKD) models assembled at Inokom Corp Sdn Bhd\u2019s plant in Kulim, Kedah. The three bread-and-butter car models are expected to contribute 75% to Berjaya Auto\u2019s sales. Currently, the company has more than 10 CBU models in its portfolio but only two CKD models. The group has delayed the launch of the Mazda 6 CKD model as it is not expected to be a high-volume driver. \u201cThe next CKD model will either be the Mazda 6 or CX-3. It could happen in the middle of next year, but nothing is firmed up yet. Mazda 6 is not in Thailand yet, so our principal wants us to build and export it to Thailand,\u201d says Lee. Out of the 12,209 units sold in FY2015, 7,552 or 62% were CBU models. Lee says CKD models will be the main sales driver in FY2016 with 60%, thanks to the full-year contribution of the locally assembled Mazda 3. Lee says Berjaya Auto will launch the new Japanese-made CX-3 in November and plans to sell 80 to 100 units each month. It will move on to the CKD project for the model in the second half of 2016. Berjaya Auto will also launch the diesel variant of Mazda 2, a CBU model imported from Thailand, in November before it brings in the new Mazda 6 and CX-5 (both with a 2.2-litre turbo diesel engine) by end-April next year. With a line-up of new Mazda cars, Lee says, Berjaya Auto aims to double its market share in the non-national car segment to 7% to 8%, which translates into 22,000 to 23,000 units a year. However, he clarifies that the group has no plans to grow sales to as big as that of Honda, Toyota and Nissan.  \u201cThis is a volume that we are very comfortable with, that\u2019s all we want to do. We might stretch ourselves if we do anything more than that. Our profit margin could be affected if we give discounts to clear stock,\u201d says Lee. He explains that the more a car maker produces, the cheaper the cars might have to be. This is because discounts will have to be given to clear stock if it is stuck with a depreciating inventory, on top of holding cost. \u201cTwo years after listing, we are still growing from a small base and it\u2019s easier to gain market share in the non-national car segment. As long as the returns to shareholders are there, and the risk is mitigated, we are happy with our volume. We would rather grow slowly and steadily every year,\u201d says Lee. He adds that Berjaya Auto, which maintains a healthy balance sheet, is committed to pay out at least 50% of its net profit as dividends in the coming years, although there is no such dividend policy in place. As at April 30, the company was sitting on a net cash position of RM280.8 million. \u201cThis is a cash-rich, debt-free and asset-light company. We want to keep it this way. If the company doesn\u2019t need the cash (for expansion), we will pay [it] out as dividends. So, you may say that Berjaya Auto is a combination of growth stock and dividend play,\u201d Lee says. Berjaya Auto, which has no plans to undertake any major M&A activity, might purchase a 5% stake in Inokom from Berjaya Corp, raising its stake to 29%. Inokom Corp is a consortium that produces 23,000 Mazda cars every year. Its other shareholders are Sime Darby Motors Sdn Bhd (51%), Hyundai Motor Co of South Korea (15%), Sime Darby Hyundai Sdn Bhd (5%) and Berjaya Corp (5%). If Berjaya Auto can establish itself as a company that delivers both consistent earnings growth and steady dividends, it would not be short of investors in the long run.

But definitely we are working on strengthening our balance sheet. The intention is to come up with a gearing ratio that is a bit more palatable for ourselves and our stakeholders,\u201d said the conglomerate\u2019s president and group chief executive Tan Sri Mohd Bakke Salleh at a press briefing after the release of its quarterly financial results. \u201cCurrently our gearing ratio is 58% as at June 30, only before then it was 38%, before the acquisition of NBPOL. If we can bring it to anywhere between 30% and 35%, that would be a lot more desirable,\u201d he explained. The group yesterday announced lower quarterly and annual earnings as the weak crude palm oil (CPO) and coal prices had taken a toll on its profits. Sime Darby\u2019s net profit slipped 17% to RM988.67 million for the fourth financial quarter ended June 30 (4QFY15), from RM1.19 billion in the previous corresponding period. Revenue, however, was higher at RM12.86 billion against RM12.56 billion previously. Its annual net profit fell sharper in the financial year ended June 30, 2015 (FY15), down 31% to RM2.31 billion from RM3.35 billion in the previous year. Revenue was marginally lower at RM43.7 billion versus RM43.9 billion the year before. The board has declared lower dividend of 19 sen per share for 4QFY15, bringing the total annual dividend to 25 sen per share for FY15, compared with 30 sen in the previous corresponding quarter and 36 sen for FY14. Mohd Bakke holds a bearish outlook on CPO prices, anticipating the edible oil to trade between RM1,900 and RM2,000 per tonne up to end-September. \u201cBeyond that (end-September), it\u2019s difficult to predict, because of the uncertain outlook,\u201d he added. He said the weakness in CPO prices had impacted the performance of Sime Darby\u2019s plantation division, as prices averaged lower during the quarter at RM2,242 per tonne. The group\u2019s industrial division registered a sharp decline in profit by 48.5%, due to the weak results in the Australasia region which shrank by 62%, no thanks to the slump in coal prices and major mining companies slashing capital expenditure and deferring scheduled maintenance because of slump in coal prices. Asked if the group is looking to expand its operations, Mohd Bakke said if there are any opportunities for synergistic mergers and acquisitions, Sime Darby will consider them. \u201cIt\u2019s not all doom and gloom currently, even in bad times, there will be opportunities to pick up new assets or to enter into strategic collaborations with other players,\u201d he said. Anything that complements Sime Darby\u2019s five core businesses would be considered, he added. Sime Darby\u2019s share price has fallen from the year\u2019s peak of RM9.50 in February to a low of RM7.02 on Monday. The stock rebounded yesterday to go up 33 sen or 4.6% to RM7.45, bringing its market capitalisation to RM44.22 billion. \u00a0 This article first appeared in digitaledge Daily, on August 27, 2015."}, "189": {"date_posted": "12/8/2015", "title": "Exposure to China varies, investors should not be overly alarmed, says HLIB", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 12): Investors should not be overly alarmed by China\u2019s move to devalue the yuan, as the economic giant is expected to introduce more stimulus measures to boost its economy, according to Hong Leong IB Research (HLIB Research).

It is learnt that it is negotiating a price of between RM80 and RM100 psf, which works out to RM115 million to RM143.7 million for the parcel. The sale would be a boon for Sunsuria as it had acquired the land for only about RM41 psf about three months ago. To recap, in April, Sunsuria bought the remaining 50% stake in Sime Darby Sunsuria Development Sdn Bhd that it did not own for RM173.4 million with a shareholder advance of RM16.4 million. The RM41 psf price was decided on because the tract was already net of major infrastructure enhancements done by Sime Darby. Sime Darby Sunsuria Development was a 50:50 joint venture formed by conglomerate Sime Darby Bhd and Sunsuria to undertake the development of the 330 acres with the Xiamen University Malaysia campus as the nucleus. An integrated township, dubbed \u201cSuria Serena\u201d, will arise around the campus and be strategically connected to the Express Rail Link and highways. It is not known how Sunsuria managed to obtain such a high premium for the land from the education group but the sale is likely to have a direct and positive impact on its bottom line. \u201cIt [the international education group] has a good name and is looking to capitalise on the development of the Xiamen University\u00a0 Malaysia campus in the same area. The deal should be concluded in a matter of weeks,\u201d says a source. \u201cIt looks like a good deal for Sunsuria, which stands to make a handsome gain.\u201d The RM1.3 billion Xiamen University Malaysia campus will be located in Bandar Kota Warisan, Sepang, and is slated to be built on 150 acres. The first enrolment of students will be in September this year. News reports estimate the gross development value of the 330-acre tract at RM6.4 billion. In April, Sunsuria changed its financial year-end from March 31 to Sept 30. For the 12 months ended March this year, it registered a net profit of RM4.4 million on revenue of RM77 million. It is noteworthy that Datuk Ter Leong Yap, the controlling shareholder of Sunsuria with 50.1% equity interest, only took control of the developer from previous controlling shareholder Tan Sri Robert Tan Hua Choon early last year and Sunsuria was reclassified a property company in July last year. The company has a healthy balance sheet with cash and cash equivalents of RM40.1 million as at March 31, 2015, while its short-term borrowings stood at RM30 million. It had no significant long-term debt commitments. UOB Kay Hian, one of the few research houses tracking Sunsuria, has a \u201cbuy\u201d call on the stock and a target price of RM2.16. This is at a 122.7% premium to its 97 sen close last Friday, giving the company a market capitalisation of RM614.4 million. Part of Sunsuria\u2019s appeal could be its growth possibilities. Market talk has it that it could fully acquire its 81%-owned Sunsuria 7th Avenue II, which is on a 14-acre tract with the potential to generate a GDV of RM1.3 billion. Interestingly enough, UOB Kay Hian has estimated the GDV of the 330-acre tract at more than RM10 billion. \u201cWe believe the Suria Serena township could be worth over RM10 billion as it becomes a new residential epicenture to the nearby villages and residential clusters. While the investment community is generally cautious about the property sector, the market agrees that Suria Serena will be a successful township, noting that it has the necessary ingredients of success \u2014 it envelopes the iconic Xiamen University Malaysia campus that will serve as a tourist spot, feature excellent logistics infrastructure and be adjacent to an economic activity centre [a cluster of light factories],\u201d it says in a mid-May report. Despite the bullish call and target price, the research house sees Sunsuria registering a net profit of RM5 million on revenue of RM64 million in FY2015 ending Sept 30. In the following year, the Singapore-based research house sees the company making a net profit of RM11 million on revenue of RM95 million. \u00a0 This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on July 6 - 12, 2015. \u00a0"}, "192": {"date_posted": "24/7/2015", "title": "Weekend by numbers 24.07.15 to 26.07.15", "article": "  4 ways to get artsy     IT\u2019S a girl power takeover at No Black Tie this weekend as vocal powerhouse Rozz teams up with Melissa Indot and Ida Mariana to deliver a set list of one- hit wonders.

In spite of recent negative reactions to the palm oil company\u2019s latest mega deal, he remains upbeat on the assets and is vigorously defending the proposed acquisition of a 37% stake in PT Eagle High Plantations Tbk. In a no-holds-barred interview, Emir shares with The Edge his thoughts on the world\u2019s largest producer of crude palm oil, its penchant for high-profile acquisitions and his own future with the company. The Edge: Let\u2019s be frank. What is your own take on FGV\u2019s performance since listing in 2012? Datuk Mohd Emir Mavani Abdullah: Let\u2019s look at it from a bigger perspective. When this company went for listing, it was well known that its plantations were old. Number two, the plantations were on marginal land. The land actually belonged to the settlers. Then we adopted a three-pronged approach. Number one, replanting has been very aggressive, at 15,000ha a year. Number two, we want to transform ourselves by focusing on where the customers\u2019 demand is and to look at a more commercial way of doing things. Thirdly, we look at our internal businesses \u2014 where we are performing and where we are not performing. If they are not performing, let\u2019s divest them. Do not forget that the company is new, the FELDA group is old. Also, we were impacted by the downward trend of CPO (crude palm oil) prices. Unfortunately, it happened just after we were listed. But you must have felt that the listing was done at the right time. Yes, the right time. The direction of CPO prices is beyond our control, but the company has been very profitable, and we have never failed to pay dividends. The company has the money and the plantations are profitable. And along the way, we did divest some of our non-core assets. I do realise that we have been impacted greatly by CPO pricing because of the way we are structured. We are 75% in upstream activities, but we have a very clear plan to move into non-commodity areas. Today, we are aggressively marketing our consumer products outside Malaysia. We are in the Philippines, Cambodia, Vietnam and so on. Demand for our products is increasing. For upstream plantations, by 2019, we will have the best tree profile in the world. While others are ageing down, we are going up. All these efforts will bear fruit in the very near future. Assuming the Eagle High and Golden Land acquisitions go through, FGV would have made more than RM7 billion in acquisitions in three years. Do you stand by all the deals you have made? We have been very busy in the past three years, you know that. But our positions were not large, just small parcels. We had in Pontian United Plantations about 13,000ha of land, then Asian Plantations, a young plantation of 20,000-odd ha. The Sabah acquisition (Golden Land) was also small. For us to really streamline our operations, we need to have a huge landbank. When this deal (Eagle High) came along, we looked at it very seriously because you will not get this kind of chance anytime; it is an opportunity to secure a huge landbank. You cannot be just buying small parcels here and there. The cost may be lower but the operating cost will be much higher. There are a lot of questions about Eagle High in particular. Do you feel that this acquisition is fairly valued? The Rajawali asset is not just greenfield; there is brownfield as well. When Sime Darby took over New Britain Palm Oil, you all know that they paid an 85% premium. Why would a company pay that much? The price tag for the asset may be high, but it is compensated by the size of the land. Where can you get a landbank of this size and pay a similar price as you would for a 10,000ha parcel? So, they are asking me: Why pay at two times premium to the share price? Look, every plantation stock is down these days. We evaluated the assets that they have. Another thing is the value that Rajawali will bring to FGV \u2014 access to the Indonesian market. We have not been in the Indonesian market at all. What kind of access? [Access to] Hundreds of millions of Indonesian consumers \u2026 that\u2019s what people did not see. Now, we will be able to supply our margarine, cooking oil and fats. Number two, we go there to look at not only our palm oil value chain but also our sugar business potential. There is just one lingering issue. The Rajawali group is said to be politically linked. Would this be an impediment? Let me be honest. When I first took a look at the Rajawali group, I was not aware of this political thing. I looked at it purely on its commercial value, and my team is still looking at it on that basis. We are not interested in the political context of it. After Eagle High, would you still be pursuing more acquisitions? In the current context, I will not. I will look into the whole value chain of our oleochemicals after this, from downstream to upstream. So, we will consolidate all our investments and see where we want to grow. There is continuing speculation about your position as chief executive, and your contract ends in July. Do you feel that you have done everything you intended to do during your time at FGV? I just want to say that we work as a team at FGV. Whether I\u2019m there or not, the entire team is focused on executing the strategic blueprint that we have. There is an ongoing discussion between me and the board as to the status of my contract. We will see. \u00a0 This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on June 22 - 28, 2015."}, "194": {"date_posted": "7/7/2015", "title": "HB Global, AirAsia, Yinson, TMC Life Sciences, icapital.biz, Sunway, Aeon, Sime Darby, Hartalega and Bina Darulaman", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (July 7): Based on corporate announcements and news flow today, the companies that may be in focus tomorrow (Wednesday, July 8) could be the following: HB Global, AirAsia, Yinson, TMC Life Sciences, icapital.biz, Sunway, Aeon, Sime Darby, Hartalega and Bina Darulaman. Frozen food specialist HB Global Ltd said in a reply to Bursa Malaysia this evening that it is still investigating the reason for its rise in share price and it is not aware of any unannounced corporate development or rumour on the rise of its share price. However, the company said it is still waiting for the reply from the major shareholders on the above matters. HB Global has received an unusual market activity (UMA) query from Bursa Malaysia earlier today, after its share price spiked in recent days. It closed 4.5 sen or 47.37% higher at 14 sen today, with some 5.7 million shares done. Last week, HB Global shares rose from 4.5 sen on Monday, to close at six sen on Friday.

AirAsia (fundamental: 0.2; valuation: 1.4) said the letter has no immediate effect on its Indonesian operations and the airline shall at all times continue to operate within the ambit of Indonesian laws. The Jakarta Post reported last Friday that 13 airlines, including IAA, had been given until July 31 to restructure their balance sheets in order to have positive shareholders\u2019 fund. Failing to do so, their operating permits would be suspended by the Transportation Ministry. Indonesia AirAsia\u2019s balance sheet as at March 31 shows that the low cost carrier had a shareholders fund deficit of 3.03 trillion rupiah (RM866 million), mainly due to the accumulated losses of 3.21 trillion rupiah. The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) has raised its equity stake in Yinson Holdings Bhd from 4.9% to 10.13%. In a statement today, Yinson (valuation: 1.5; fundamental: 1.5) executive chairman Lim Han Weng said EPF bought 60 million shares at RM2.83 per share in the company\u2019s private placement exercise. Just four days ago, EPF sold 1.1 million shares or its 0.11% stake in Yinson, an integrated offshore production and support services provider, which reduced its stake of 5.01% to 50.65 million or 4.91%. This occurred when Yinson announced on June 29 of the divestment of its logistics and trading business to Liannex Labuan Ltd for RM228 million to fully focus on the business of floating production storage and offloading (FSPO). Last month, EPF had unloaded 8.64 million shares, or 0.84% stake in Yinson. Johor crown prince Tunku Ismail Ibni Sultan Ibrahim has emerged as a substantial shareholder holding a 7.67% stake in TMC Life Sciences Bhd, in which Singaporean tycoon Peter controls a 70.5% stake. A filing to Bursa Malaysia showed that Tunku Ismail was issued the 133 million TMC Life shares after he sold an indirect 30% stake in BB Waterfront Sdn Bhd. TMC (fundamental: 1.45; valuation: 0.9) took over the entire stake in BB Waterfront, a wholly-owned unit of Best Blend Sdn Bhd, for RM400 million by issue of shares. The Johor royalty held a 30% stake and Lim owned the remaining 70% in Best Blend. BB Waterfront owns Thomson Iskandar, a medical hub project located on 1.6ha in Stulang Laut. The medical hub will contain a hospital named \u201cIskandariah Hospital\u201d. Co-located with the hospital is an outpatient medical centre that will contain 400 clinic suites.

The retail offering closed at 5pm on July 6, 2015 (Monday). Japan's Aeon Co Ltd is interested in buying the Malaysian operations of Britain's Tesco Plc, valued at about 900 million pounds ($1.4 billion), people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Buying Tesco's operations would make Aeon Malaysia's biggest hypermarkets group. The Japanese retailer has 28 hypermarkets in the country and plans to open 100 more stores in various formats by 2020. Aeon also owns 51.7% of Aeon Co M Bhd (fundamental: 1.75; valuation: 0.5), which has 29 outlets and four MaxValu supermarkets in Malaysia. Tesco is currently seeking buyers for its US$6 billion South Korean business and a stake in data-gathering arm Dunnhumby, to fund a turnaround in its core home market. Britain's biggest retailer is recovering from an accounting scandal and the loss of market share to discount chains Aldi and Lidl. Aeon, has informally discussed its interest with corporate advisers, one person familiar with the matter said. Tesco, which has not expressed any intention to sell its Malaysian business, declined to comment. A spokesman for Aeon said the company is not in negotiations with Tesco. A spokesman for Sime Darby Bhd, which owns 30% of Tesco's Malaysian arm, said the Malaysian plantation-to-autos conglomerate will always evaluate opportunities that may enhance shareholder value.

In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, Hartalega said the bonus issue was to raise its issued and paid-up share capital of the company to reflect its current scale and that of its subsidiaries. \u201cIt also allows greater participation in the equity of the company in terms of the number of Hartalega shares held whilst maintaining the equity interest. It would (also) improve trading liquidity of shares on Bursa Securities (Financial Dashboard),\u201d it said. It said the proposed bonus issue is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2015. Hartalega has appointed RHB Investment Bank as its adviser for the proposals. Meanwhile, Bina Darulaman Bhd (BDB) expects its revenue to grow 10% for its financial year ending Dec 31, 2015 (FY15), mainly driven by its property development segment. Its group managing director Datuk Izham Yusoff said that the group will pursue aggressive property development this year, with a focus on the affordable housing market in Kedah. BDB (fundamental: 1.2; valuation: 2.6) plans to launch an affordable housing project in Langkawi, which will see the roll out of 500 apartment units in Kuah by the end of the year. BDB also has three other projects in Langkawi, which includes the development of a 200-acre piece of hillside land and the development of another 13 acres of land in the mangrove area for ecotourism villas. The group is also in talks with the Langkawi Municipal Council to jointly upgrade the Kuah jetty facilities and to construct a hotel and multi-storey car park nearby. Izham said the four projects in Langkawi has a combined gross development value of RM1.5 billion, to be realised over five to seven years.

When asked whether MCIL (fundamental: 2.40; valuation: 1.80) is indeed taking that business path, management, in a written reply, says, \u201cIn view of the fast-changing media landscape, both locally and overseas, it has long been MCIL\u2019s strategy to seek diversification opportunities. \u201cIn order to grow its non-traditional revenue stream further while consolidating its market share in print media, MCIL will spare no effort to improve profitability and operational efficiency through diversification, including [venturing into] property development, if possible.\u201d On whether the group is in talks with other parties to develop part of its land parcels, including that in Jalan Riong, Bangsar, Kuala Lumpur, management says, \u201c... provided good business opportunities present themselves ... but MCIL is not at liberty to disclose any specific locations at the moment.\u201d MCIL\u2019s 42,716 sq ft freehold tract in Bangsar is in a prime location, just next to the office of Media Prima Bhd\u2019s New Straits Times Press. It is no secret that Media Prima (fundamental: 1.95; valuation: 1.40) is exploring the possibility of redeveloping the low-rise office building into a high-rise block called Media Prima Tower. \u201cShould MCIL and Media Prima combine and package their parcels in Jalan Riong, the potential value for both parties would be higher than if they sell them separately,\u201d says an industry source. The net book value of MCIL\u2019s land and buildings stood at US$64.5 million (RM240.9 million) as at March 31, 2015, down from US$74.5 million a year earlier, mainly due to currency conversion difference and annual depreciation charges, management says. \u201cThese properties will continue to be used by MCIL in its newspaper publishing and printing operations worldwide,\u201d it adds. Meanwhile, sources tell The Edge that Ancom Bhd \u2014 the parent company of Redberry Media Group \u2014 is also considering developing a 1.31ha tract in Section 13, Petaling Jaya, where its media business is located. The leasehold land, which is owned by Ancom (fundamental: 0.55; valuation: 1.20), had a net book value of RM28.8 million as at May 31, 2014. As it is housing low-rise office and factory buildings, its yield is low. Coming up just behind the tract is the centreSTAGE project \u2014 an integrated development comprising shoplexes, designer and serviced suites and a hotel. \u201cThe group is exploring a few schemes to unlock the value of the land, and one of them is to work with a property developer. For centreSTAGE, the initial price was about RM400 psf. Today, the price of new projects in the vicinity is more than RM600 psf,\u201d says a source familiar with the matter. \u201cNow, it is about timing as well as deciding on the right route to take.\u201d A sales agent with another nearby project known as PJ Midtown says its serviced apartments are priced at RM860 psf and scheduled for completion in 2018. The development, undertaken by IOI Properties Group Bhd and Sime Darby Brunsfield, is a stone\u2019s throw from centreSTAGE and a five-minute drive from the Ancom tract. PJ Midtown will feature serviced apartments, offices and shophouses. It is worth noting that Star Media Group Bhd (fundamental: 2.50; valuation: 1.40) had taken such a path in 2011 when it sold a six-acre parcel that previously housed the group\u2019s office in Section 13, Petaling Jaya, to JAKS Island Circle Sdn Bhd. As part of the deal, Star Media Group will also get a 13-storey office building with a built-up of 270,000 sq ft, to be called Star Tower. Analysts say it makes sense for media players to look at unlocking the value of their land. \u201cSome of the parcels they are sitting on are in prime locations. They should consider monetising them. After all, from a media operation standpoint, the industry is facing an uphill battle, and this is reflected in the decline in earnings,\u201d says an analyst with a bank. MCIL, which publishes the top four Chinese newspapers in the country, saw its revenue and net profit drop 8.4% and 36.9% year on year to US$429.1 million and US$31.1 million respectively in the financial year ended March 31, 2015. The decrease in earnings was attributed to the recognition of an impairment loss of goodwill and an allowance for impairment loss of interest in an associate, totalling over US$7 million. Analysts say the decline was cushioned by lower newsprint costs and savings from the group\u2019s ongoing stringent cost management. Apart from Malaysia, MCIL has printing and publishing businesses in Hong Kong, China and North America. AmResearch, in a May 29 report on MCIL, says it expects earnings to remain flat in the coming quarters in view of a challenging economic outlook, particularly in Malaysia, which implemented the Goods and Services Tax in April. It adds that on a positive note, MCIL\u2019s lean operating structure and cost-saving initiatives are beginning to show results.

Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd\u2019s (KLK) FY16F PER valuation of 21.6 times is cheaper than Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd\u2019s (FGV) 24.6 times but close to IOI Corp Bhd\u2019s 21.1 times and Sime Darby Bhd\u2019s 20 times. Among the big-cap plantation companies, we like KLK for to its young oil palm trees, efficient production costs and healthy balance sheet. The average age of the group\u2019s oil palm trees is only 11 years old compared with FGV\u2019s 15 years, IOI Corp\u2019s 12 to 13 years and Sime Darby\u2019s 14.5 years (excluding New Britain Palm Oil Ltd).\u00a0 KLK\u2019s balance sheet is clean. The group\u2019s net gearing stood at 21.5% as at end-March 2015 compared with IOI\u2019s 97.3%, FGV\u2019s 31.1% (before the acquisition of 37% of PT Eagle High Plantations Tbk) and Sime Darby\u2019s 47.2%. We forecast KLK\u2019s fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production to rise 4% in FY15F and 5.5% in FY16F. Most of the improvements in FFB production are expected to be driven by an increase in mature areas. Mature areas are envisaged to expand by 3% each in FY15F and FY16F compared with 4% or 8,549ha in FY14.\u00a0 We expect new plantings of oil palm to be slow in Liberia as KLK is currently conducting high carbon stock studies. In spite of this, we reckon that KLK is on track towards replanting about 1,000ha of oil palm trees in the country this year. We estimate the replanting cost at more than RM10,000 per hectare. Manufacturing earnings before interest and tax are expected to decline by 24% in FY15F before recovering by 15% in FY16F. We do not expect the crisis in Greece to affect KLK\u2019s oleochemical operations in Europe significantly. More than half of the division\u2019s profits are driven by operations in Malaysia.\u00a0 Also, earnings from the acquisition of Emery Oleochemicals GmbH\u2019s operations in Germany are not anticipated to be significant. We believe that the unit is breaking even. We reckon that KLK would be integrating its fatty acids operations in Emmerich with Emery\u2019s operations in Dusseldorf to reap synergistic benefits. As both plants are located close to each other, we think that KLK would be able to integrate the marketing and distribution networks of the companies. KLK proposed to acquire Emery\u2019s oleochemical assets in Germany for \u20ac40.5 million or RM169 million in May 2015. \u2014 AmResearch, July 2  This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on July 3, 2015."}, "197": {"date_posted": "26/6/2015", "title": "Earnings rebound unlikely for CPO players", "article": " ALTHOUGH the price of crude palm oil (CPO) has largely stabilised at around RM2,200 per tonne over the past six months, the earnings of plantation companies have continued to weaken, as reflected in the latest results season. A key concern now is that despite a slew of bullish catalysts on the horizon, such as El Ni\u00f1o and Indonesia\u2019s B15 implementation, major plantation players remain encumbered by lower operating margins as well as high unrealised foreign exchange losses. Weaker average selling prices and lower fresh fruit bunch (FFB) output in the first quarter of the year resulted in a major earnings decline among the upstream players. Apart from the decline in revenue, the lower FFB output has also dented operating margins, as millers were underutilised following floods in the East Coast states late last year. Rabobank International director of food and agribusiness research Pawan Kumar says the earnings outlook for plantation firms remains bleak for the rest of the year. \u201cWe forecast both production and CPO prices to remain weak in the second quarter. Existing negative fundamentals will hit the pure players the hardest. But the integrated players are better capitalised and can actively pursue income diversification. Those with downstream exposure in Indonesia have an added advantage,\u201d he says. This will put the spotlight on companies such as Singapore-listed Wilmar International Ltd and Golden Agri-Resources Ltd, which are large integrated players with substantial downstream operations in Indonesia. The Indonesian government has big plans to support domestic palm oil consumption, including its push for the implementation of the B15 biodiesel mandate as well as export levies of US$50 per tonne for CPO and US$30 per tonne for processed palm oil products. The two initiatives will stoke up domestic demand in Indonesia, which in turn will help the refiners that are currently operating at well below capacity. The proposed levies will go towards subsidising its biodiesel industry, incentivising plantation companies to ramp up production. \u201cIn the near term, we prefer integrated players that are able to enjoy the margin difference on the levy of US$20 per tonne between upstream and downstream products,\u201d says CIMB Research analyst Maureen Natasha in a May research note. Wilmar (fundamental: 0.80; valuation: 1.00) owns two biodiesel plants in Indonesia with a combined capacity of two million kilolitres per annum. Similarly, Golden Agri-Resources (fundamental: 0.55; valuation: 1.20) has committed up to US$300 million to expand its downstream operations in Indonesia. Jakarta-listed integrated players such as PT Astra Agro Lestari Tbk and PT Salim Ivomas Pratama Tbk are also expected to benefit, as palm oil exports form only a small proportion of their total sales. Malaysian integrated players look set to continue to be affected by weaker upstream contributions and lack of government support in the downstream segment. With no direct subsidies, unlike in Indonesia, refiners continue to operate well below capacity and post losses due to negative refining margins. The reliance on contributions from the upstream segment was reflected in the recent results for the quarter ended March 31, which seemed to have underwhelmed analysts\u2019 consensus expectations. For example, Sime Darby Bhd\u2019s plantations division saw its gross profit decline 7.8% y-o-y to RM99.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, due to low production and weak selling prices. Profit at its midstream and downstream operations fell 55.3% to RM30.3 million from RM67.8 million a year ago. \u201cThe lower profit was attributable to lower off-take of biodiesel from petroleum companies due to the drop in crude oil prices and lower sales volume of differentiated products,\u201d Sime Darby (fundamental: 0.80; valuation: 1.40) says in notes to its financial statements. Major players such as Felda Global Ventures Bhd (FGV) and Genting Plantations Bhd saw double-digit percentage declines in their FFB production on an annual basis, which affected their gross incomes. For 1QFY2015, FGV (fundamental: 1.55; valuation: 1.40) reported a 38% drop in gross profit to RM363.1 million year-on-year while Genting Plantations (fundamental: 1.20; valuation: 1.10) saw its gross profit fall 25% y-o-y to RM115.1 million. However, even gross profits are being diluted from the companies\u2019 foreign exchange exposure, as has been the case over the past year. The ringgit and rupiah have plummeted to new multi-year lows. \u201cIt is not just a question of compressed margins anymore. Unrealised forex losses are a long-term burden as we do not see any recovery for Asian currencies against the US dollar. While unseasonable weather can bring down production from record high levels, regional and global demand for palm oil is still the key determinant of prices,\u201d says a plantations analyst at a bank-backed research house. The forex exposure of some of the integrated players has impacted their net income. For example, IOI Corp Bhd (fundamental: 1.20; valuation: 1.10) reported a net loss of RM188 million on the back of unrealised forex losses of RM333 million. Similarly, IJM Plantations Bhd (fundamental: 1.60; valuation: 0.80) saw its net profit dwindle to RM10 million in its latest quarterly results, largely due to unrealised forex losses of RM51.36 million. Rabobank\u2019s Kumar says a silver lining for the upstream players would be the growth in India\u2019s demand for palm oil. \u201cImports should continue to pick up this year mainly because there is not a lot of domestic supply in India. An expected widening of the spread between soy oil and palm oil prices will also be supportive of the latter, as edible oil consumers will become more price sensitive.\u201d Weak demand for palm oil this year has resulted in a growing stockpile, despite the bump in exports seen recently. According to Malaysian Palm Oil Board data, the closing stock of crude and processed palm oil in Malaysia amounted to 2.19 million tonnes, not far from the all-time high of 2.62 million tonnes recorded in 2013. The government has decided to keep export tax at zero until the end of June in a bid to clear existing stock. The bullish catalysts, while good for investor sentiment, is unlikely to have an impact on CPO\u2019s fundamentals anytime soon, at least until the current stockpile can be meaningfully reduced. According to Anglo-Eastern Plantations PLC executive director of finance Datuk Lim Ewe Chuan, this is the main factor that influences the industry\u2019s future prospects. \u201cIn the near term, any upside on the CPO price may be limited in view of seasonally higher production and large stockpiles,\u201d he says. \u00a0 This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on June 1 - 7, 2015."}, "198": {"date_posted": "5/6/2015", "title": "Tanjung Offshore, Malakoff, Genting Plantations, MClean, Sime Darby, Tune Insurance, Xian Leng, Biosis and Golden Land", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (June 5): Based on corporate announcements and news flow today, the companies that may be in focus next week (Monday, Jun 8) could be: Tanjung Offshore, Malakoff, Genting Plantations, MClean, Sime Darby, Tune Insurance, Xian Leng, Biosis and Golden Land. A forensic audit on Tanjung Offshore Bhd reveals the company has taken shortcuts and a sequence of shortcomings that had given way to corporate weakness.

Tanjung Offshore (fundamental: 1.85; valuation: 0.9) said it will also engage a lawyer to review the two transactions and consult legal professional views, if there were any wrongdoing in the Gastec deal and the purchase of the UK property. However, the recommendations of the forensic audit were not revealed in the press statement. Tanjung Offshore said it is bound by confidentiality agreements so as not to reveal the information to the public.

Maybank IB is Malakoff\u2019s stabilising manager. It was also Malakoff\u2019s transaction and joint-lead manager, which oversaw the group\u2019s relisting on Bursa Malaysia on May 15, 2015 at RM1.80 apiece. Malakoff said Maybank IB had acquired 188.5 million of its shares during the stabilising period, equivalent to some 12.4% of the total number of shares offered during its listing. Malakoff said Maybank IB had purchased its shares at between RM1.7048 per share and RM1.7952 per share. Oil palm miller Genting Plantations Bhd\u2019s wholly-owned unit, Benih Restu Bhd, has issued RM1 billion sukuk under its maiden Sukuk Murabahah Programme of up to RM1.5 billion in nominal value.

Industrial equipment manufacturer CN Asia Corp Bhd (fundamental: 0; valuation: 0.9) plans to diversify its business to property development by acquiring two adjacent plots of land in Selangor, totalling 237.48 acres, for RM20.5 million. In a filing to Bursa Malaysia, CN Asia said it has signed two separate sale and purchase agreements today, to effect the purchase. One was with Crystal Bond Sdn Bhd who owns a plot of 117.66-acre land with a net book value of RM300,000, while the second was with Marvellous Production Sdn Bhd who owns the remaining 119.82 acres with a net book value of RM6.6 million. Both plots are located on Jalan Balakong, Seri Kembangan. To finance the land buy, CN Asia has proposed a cash call to raise up to RM45.38 million via a 2-for-1 renounceable rights issue \u2014 based on an indicative issue price of RM0.50 per rights share \u2014 together with free warrants. Under the proposed cash call, it plans to issue up to 90.765 million rights shares on the basis of two rights shares for every existing share, along the issuance of up to 68.07 million warrants on the basis of three warrants for every four rights shares, which will be offered for subscription at an entitlement date to be determined later.

IGB Corp Bhd\u2019s net profit rose 10% to RM65.1 million in the first quarter ended Mar 31, 2015 (1QFY15), from RM59.2 million a year ago, on higher revenue, which rose 13.7% to RM334.3 million, from RM294.1 million previously. IGB Corp (fundamental: 1.6; valuation: 2.2) told Bursa that the improved quarterly performance was underpinned by improved contributions from its property development and property investment divisions. On prospects, IGB Corp expects 2015 to be a challenging year, hence it is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d its FY15 performance will be satisfactory. Pos Malaysia Bhd\u2019s net profit plunged 61.9% to RM19.9 million or 3.71 sen a share for the fourth financial quarter ended March 31, 2015 (4QFY15), from RM52.2 million or 9.72 sen a share a year ago, on higher operating expenses. Revenue for the quarter was also down 6.8% to RM395.54 million, from RM424.37 million in 4QFY14. In a filing with Bursa, the postal group said net profit for the full FY15 dropped 20.1% to RM127.05 million or 23.66 sen a share, from RM158.98 million or 29.6 sen a share in FY14. Revenue, however, rose 4.7% to RM1.49 billion, from RM1.43 billion in FY14. Going forward, the group said its performance for FY16 is expected to remain favourable. Resort and property developer Landmarks Bhd has slipped into the red in the first quarter ended March 31, 2015 (1QFY15), after posting a net loss of RM1.54 million or 0.32 sen per share, from a net profit of RM1.6 million or 0.33 sen per share. In a filing with Bursa, Landmarks said its earnings were dragged by its \u201ccontinued construction works for infrastructure and the Crystal Lagoon in Phase 1 of Treasure Bay Bintan\u201d in Indonesia, which are ongoing and have yet to make any positive financial contribution to the group. Quarterly revenue, meanwhile, was up 9.6% to RM19.3 million, from RM17.62 million. Properties like The Andaman saw higher average room rate, which rose 11.9%, boosted by the hotel's newly-renovated rooms, and food and beverage offerings. Moving forward, Landmarks (fundamental: 1.65; valuation: 0.9) said it is cautiously optimistic on tourism in the region. Sarawak Plantation Bhd\u2019s net profit for the first quarter ended March 31 (1QFY15) plummeted 57.4% to RM7.4 million or 2.65 sen per share, on lower realised average selling prices (ASP) and lower sales volumes of crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel (PK). This compares to a net profit of RM17.4 million or 6.23 sen per share in the previous corresponding quarter. The firm\u2019s revenue also came in 31.8% lower at RM70.9 million, from RM104.0 million in 1QFY14.

Property developer Hua Yang Bhd said its net profit fell by 21% to RM29.7 million or 11.25 sen per share for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2015 (4QFY15), from RM37.81 million or 14.32 sen per share a year ago, on lower revenue for its property development division. Quarterly revenue fell 23% to RM152.11 million, from RM198.26 million in 4QFY14, as the property developer faced lower sales recognition and slower construction progress. Despite lower quarterly earnings, its net profit for full FY15 was up 34.6% to RM110.56 million or 41.88 sen per share, from RM82.17 million or 31.12 sen per share in FY14; revenue rose 14.4% to RM583.58 million, from RM509.89 million in the same period.

The write-backs had mitigated the impact of lower revenue, as interest and Islamic banking income fell, AMMB said in a filing to Bursa Malaysia today.\nIt said revenue was lower at RM2.22 billion, compared to RM2.44 billion. For the full year, AMMB (fundamental: 1.7; valuation: 3) said its net profit climbed to RM1.92 billion, from RM1.78 billion a year earlier. Revenue, however, decreased to RM9.14 billion, from RM9.61 billion. The group has proposed a dividend of 15.3 sen per share for 4QFY15, bringing full-year dividends to 27.3 sen. Sime Darby Bhd's net profit fell 55% to RM386.04 million in the third quarter ended March 31, 2015 (3QFY15), from RM852.53 million a year earlier, on lower contribution from its plantation, industrial and automobile divisions. Sime Darby's (fundamental: 1; valuation: 1.1) revenue declined to RM10 billion, from RM10.1 billion. For 9MFY15, net profit declined to RM1.32 billion, from RM2.16 billion a year earlier. Revenue contracted to RM30.86 billion, from RM31.39 billion. Sime Darby's president and group chief executive Tan Sri Mohd Bakke Salleh said: \"The third quarter of the current financial year continued to be negatively impacted by tough business conditions, amidst macroeconomic headwinds in several regions.\" Mohd Bakke also said that Sime Darby is unlikely to meet its headline key performance indicator (KPI) target of RM2.5 billion net profit for the financial year ending June 30, 2015 (FY15), and a return on equity (ROE) of 8.5%. Instead, he said the group is now hoping to close FY15 with a net profit of RM2 billion to RM2.1 billion. Industrial chemicals distributor Samchem Holdings Bhd is aiming for a 5% revenue growth in the financial year ending Dec 31, 2015 (FY15), by securing more business from regional markets. The firm intends to achieve the target by securing more clients across Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia and Cambodia, said Samchem's (fundamental: 0.5; valuation: 2) chief executive officer Datuk Ng Lian Poh.

Sime Darby president and group chief executive Tan Sri Mohd Bakke Salleh said the group is now hoping to close FY15 with a net profit of RM2 billion to RM2.1 billion instead. \"The net profit for the cumulative 10 months (until end of April) is RM1.5 billion. So it is impossible for us to get RM1 billion over the next two months,\" Sime Darby president and group chief executive Tan Sri Mohd Bakke Salleh told reporters after a briefing on the group's third quarter of FY15 ended March 31, 2015 (3QFY15) results today. He said the group does not expect to achieve its FY15 KPI due to low CPO prices and other conditions affecting business in its others divisions. Mohd Bakke said the KPI target of achieving RM2.5 billion in net profit for FY15 is based on several assumptions, the more notable of which is a crude palm oil (CPO) price of at least RM2,350 per tonne. Mohd Bakke said he expects CPO prices to average between RM2,200 to RM2,400 up until the end of the calendar year of 2015. He said prices may go higher if the El Nino effect were to kick in this year, but added \"it is too early to look into the El Nino effects\" now. Sime Darby Plantation managing director Datuk Franki Anthony Dass said the company will only be sure of the effects of El Nino on its plantations from July onwards, especially in Indonesia. He said a moderately strong El Nino will reduce production of fresh fruit bunches (FFB) by 6% to 10% and a severe occurence could reduce FFB production by 15%. He also shared that the group's construction on the mini oil mill in Liberia will be completed by October this year. Sime Darby Group chief financial officer (CFO) Datuk Tong Poh Keow said the average CPO price realised in 3QFY15 was RM2,209 per tonne, down 14% on-year from RM2,573 per tonne previously.\u00a0 Tong also said lower coal and mineral prices, together with the strengthening of the US dollar, had affected the group's industrial division, especially its Australasia and China operations, as well as its motor division. The group is planning to cut its workforce in its industrial division's Australian and Chinese operations by some 2,000 workers by the end of June this year. Separately, Mohd Bakke said the government's plan to set up the Malaysian Vision Valley in Negri Sembilan on 108,000 ha of land under the 11th Malaysia plan will be a boon for the group. \"We have some estates that are part and parcel of the Malaysian Vision Valley. We are blessed to have landbanks in the growth corridor,\" he said. The Malaysian Vision Valley, to be located in western Negri Sembilan, will cover Nilai, Seremban and Port Dickson. It was announced by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak yesterday as a new integrated development encompassing several strategic clusters to complement the developments in the Klang Valley, particularly in Putrajaya and Kuala Lumpur. Mohd Bakke also said the group has put on hold its plan to list its divisions, pending more favourable market and business conditions. \"There is no rush, no push factor. We are still growing the business and looking for opportunities in the market to expand,\" he added. Sime Darby had, in February, deferred the listing of its auto division.

According to notes accompanying Sime Darby's financials, 9MFY15 plantation profit fell 45.9% from a year earlier while industrial division recorded a 51.1% fall. The automobile unit's profit was 17.8% lower. The group attributed the plantation profit decline to lower oil palm output and crude palm oil (CPO) prices. Lower income from downstream operations also led to less profit. \"Lower fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production was registered in both Malaysia and Indonesia by 7.8% and 7.3% respectively. The decline in FFB production in Malaysia and Indonesia was largely attributable to the change in cropping pattern driven by severe weather conditions,\" Sime Darby said. The group said it registered an average CPO price of RM2,171 a tonne against RM2,439 a year earlier. Meanwhile, the industrial segment's profit drop was largely due to lower equipment delivery and product support sales to the mining sector in Australia. \"Commodity prices continue to decline and coal prices in Australia are now at near marginal cost of production. As a result, the market for equipment continued to contract and competition in the product support business is intense,\" Sime Darby said. The group's automobile sales in Malaysia had contended with the impact of the goods and services tax (GST). Sime Darby said the GST, which was implemented from April 1 this year, had generated uncertainty among consumers. \"Malaysia was affected by lower contribution from Hyundai and Jaguar Land Rover as sales and margin were negatively impacted due to the uncertainty on the goods and services tax and the abolishment of sales tax on 1 April 2015,\" Sime Darby said.

Towards this end, Oriental is understood to be reviewing its dealership of Hyundai vehicles with Sime Darby Bhd. \u201cThe deal with Sime (Darby) was not going very well for Oriental. With Proton, at least there is bound to be more sales volume compared with Hyundai,\u201d the source says. Oriental once held the distribution rights to certain Hyundai models via a 60% stake in Oriental-Hyundai Sdn Bhd (OHB). But it sold the stake to Sime in 2009 for RM19.8 million after the latter took over a unit of Berjaya Group that held the rights to other Hyundai models. While it no longer has the franchise, Oriental still has six outlets dealing with Hyundai vehicles as well as a number of outlets dealing in Honda and Mitsubishi vehicles. In Proton\u2019s case, it is not clear where Oriental will fit into the picture, considering the already crowded dealership network under wholly owned distribution arm Proton Edar Sdn Bhd. There are already 413 Proton sales and/ or service outlets throughout Malaysia, the majority of which are run by third-party operators. Nonetheless, Proton Edar recently announced a new dealership expansion programme, inviting interested parties to invest in new Proton 3S (sales, service and spare parts) dealerships nationwide. Oriental, founded by the late Tan Sri Loh Boon Siew, is an old and respected name in the automotive industry. Loh secured the Honda vehicle franchise in 1969 and his family controlled the business until 2001, when Oriental gave back majority control to Honda Japan. Eventually, Oriental retained a 15% associate stake in the local Honda operation with new party DRB-Hicom Bhd coming in with 34%, and the Japanese principal holding 51%. Having lost the Honda franchise and then exiting OHB, Oriental has focused on growing its oil palm plantation business in Indonesia, which has since become a major earnings contributor. Nonetheless, the group remains committed to the automotive business. In its financial year ended Dec 31, 2014, Oriental posted a net profit of RM328.1 million on revenue of RM3.5 billion. Close to RM2 billion or 56% of the revenue came from the automotive and related businesses. Just last year, Kah Motor Co Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oriental, announced plans to invest RM150 million in expanding and upgrading its showroom and service centres for its Honda dealership, including boosting its presence in Sabah and Sarawak. Amid a challenging economic environment, the automotive total industry volume grew a marginal 1.63% to 666,465 units last year, according to the Malaysian Automotive Association (MAA). Proton recorded sales of 115,783 units last year for a market share of 17.4%, down from 21.2% in 2013, when it sold 138,753 cars. Meanwhile, Hyundai sold 10,271 units for a 1.5% market share, falling from 12,217 units in 2013. While Hyundai sales have been described as stagnant, due to aggressive marketing efforts by Japanese marques such as Toyota, Honda and Nissan, Proton\u2019s fortunes have been sliding and it has fallen further behind market leader Perodua. Amid falling sales, the timing of Proton\u2019s dealership expansion programme has raised eyebrows. \u201cIf (Proton) is not a growing brand, why would Oriental want to associate itself with it?\u201d asks an automotive industry veteran. Nevertheless, Oriental is no stranger to Proton\u2019s parent DRB-Hicom as they are both shareholders of the local Honda franchise. Industry observers say there could still be opportunities from setting up big 3S outlets for Proton, notably to cater for the ever-increasing aftersales business for the national car.

The master plan is slated to be completed by the fourth quarter of this year. \u201cWe bought the land at a good price, so we can do something like this (farmstead) \u2026 the selling point is that it will be an eco-friendly development located just about an hour out of Kuala Lumpur,\u201d says Bina Puri executive director Matthew Tee Kai Woon. In February, Bina Puri announced the acquisition of some 1,600 acres in Bentong for RM47.5 million, which works out to less than RM30,000 an acre. According to Tee, a river flows through the area, so Bina Puri merely has to make diversions to ensure that more of the land is beautified and more owners have access to the river. \u201cThis is something different. We are not putting all our eggs in one basket. Not all developments have to be in Iskandar Malaysia, Johor, or in Kuala Lumpur,\u201d he remarks. According to Bina Puri\u2019s announcement to Bursa Malaysia, the gross development value of the land is RM279 million and \u201cthe purchase consideration was funded by a combination of internally generated funds and bank borrowings of RM38 million\u201d. It was also announced that Bina Puri\u2019s gearing will increase to almost 3.2 from just below 3 times now. As at end-December last year, Bina Puri had cash and bank balances of RM61.1 million and deposits with licensed banks of RM10.8 million. On the other side of the balance sheet, the company had short-term borrowings of RM409.9 million and long-term debt commitments of RM208.7 million. It is also noteworthy that Bina Puri will take on an additional RM38 million in borrowings for the acquisition of the 1,600 acres. \u00a0 For the year ended Dec 31, 2014, Bina Puri paid RM15.5 million in finance costs, in contrast to its net profits, which was RM6.1 million on the back of almost RM1.1 billion in revenue. Given its high gearing, Bina Puri has been raising capital via a private placement of 37.4 million new shares or 20% of its enlarged issued and paid-up share capital. This followed a reduction in its issued and paid-up capital via the cancellation of 50 sen of the par value of RM1 shares in December last year. Earlier this month, a third tranche of almost 4.3 million shares was issued at 51.5 sen apiece. The first tranche of almost 7.5 million shares was issued at 50 sen in early January and another tranche of 15 million shares at 50.5 sen was issued at the end of February. Tee is not worried about the high gearing, saying that the company already has strategic investors for the farmstead project, which is a long-term play. \u201cLike in all our developments, we have strategic investors in place. The only thing we have to do is build some of the infrastructure \u2014 ensure there is water and electricity. The main access roads are already built,\u201d he says. Via Aksi Bina Puri Sdn Bhd, Bina Puri owns 70% of the land, with the remaining 30% equally divided between private companies Wealthy Terrace Sdn Bhd, Kochbil Corp Sdn Bhd, Resintech Plastics (M) Sdn Bhd and Valiant Plus Sdn Bhd. A check with the Companies Commission of Malaysia indicates that Wealthy Terrace is equally owned by Ng Lui Keng @ Ng Joo Keng and Tan Wang Tiang, while Kochbil Corp is equally owned by Ooi Thian Huang and North Port Bulk Services Sdn Bhd. Resintech Plastics is wholly owned by Resintech Bhd, a company controlled by Datuk Dr Teh Kim Poo. Valiant Plus is owned by Lim Boon Siong (90%) and Lim Boon Han (10%). Ng and Tan are familiar names in Corporate Malaysia. They used three private companies \u2014 Perintis Harmoni Sdn Bhd, Emerald Profile Sdn Bhd and Saujana Tertib Sdn Bhd \u2014 to purchase 15% in Road Builder (M) Holdings and flipped it to IJM Corp Bhd, leading to the takeover of Road Builder in 2006. In March 2013, Sime Darby Motors Sdn Bhd, a unit of plantation giant Sime Darby Bhd, acquired Timeless Diamond Sdn Bhd from the two men for RM2. North Port Bulk Services is understood to be linked to the Chia family that controls QL Resources Bhd. While Bina Puri may have secured strong partners for the farmstead development, it is worth noting that more than 83% of its revenue for FY2014 was from construction, while property development accounted for only slightly more than 10%.\u00a0 \u00a0 Nevertheless, the company\u2019s property division registered a profit before tax of RM67.6 million for FY2014. In the notes accompanying its financials, Bina Puri says its 50%-owned unit KL-Kuala Selangor Bhd, which operates the Latar Expressway, incurred a loss of RM45.2 million in 2014, largely due to finance costs of RM64.8 million incurred during the year, which dragged down earnings. As at end-March, Bina Puri had a construction order book of RM2.1 billion, which should keep the company busy for the next two years, at least. Bina Puri closed last Thursday at 57 sen, giving it a market capitalisation of RM114.5 million. The only research house that covers the stock is TA Securities, which has a \u201cbuy\u201d on it, and a target price of 67 sen. \u00a0 This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on April 20 - 26, 2015."}, "212": {"date_posted": "7/5/2015", "title": "CPO prices boosted by Indonesia export levies", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: Crude palm oil (CPO) prices rebounded yesterday reversing the downtrend since March on news that Indonesia President Joko Widodo has decided to slap an export levy of US$50 (RM178.50) per tonne on CPO and US$30 per tonne on processed palm oil products The three-month July CPO futures contract traded higher at RM2,183 per tonne, a RM26 or 1.2% increase from the previous closing price of RM2,157 per tonne. Prices of the benchmark contract have been trending downward since March 2 when the price was at RM2,360 per tonne, and they touched as low as RM2,082 per tonne at the end of last month. The export levies were reportedly imposed to fund Indonesia\u2019s recently announced biodiesel subsidies and it could help to underpin palm oil prices if biodiesel demand picks up. In a statement yesterday, Minister of Plantation Industry and Commodities Datuk Amar Douglas Uggah Embas said the government is \u201cclosely\u201d monitoring the situation and analysing any possible impact of Indonesia\u2019s export levies on the Malaysian palm oil industry. He said a task force was formed to discuss and recommend policy options to the government. CIMB Research\u2019s analyst Ivy Ng Lee Fang told The Edge Financial Daily that the research house was not surprised by the news as the market had been anticipating the implementation of the levies since early April. \u201cDetails on the new regulations like whether all or selected processed palm oil products will be taxed remain unclear,\u201d she said. Ng pointed that the export levies will not go down well with Indonesian plantation owners because the tax will result in refiners squeezing the planters for lower prices. \u201cHowever, this could be offset by medium-term gains from higher CPO prices if the move boosts biodiesel usage significantly,\u201d she said. An analyst explained that the impact on companies like Sime Darby (fundamental: 1.0; valuation: 1.1) and KLK (fundamental: 1.0; valuation: 0.5) would not be significant as both have exposure of merely 30% to 40%. Kenanga Research analyst Voon Yee Ping said the new policy would reduce export volume from Indonesia, thus benefiting Malaysian palm oil producers. \u201cThere will be restricted supply in the market in the short to medium term,\u201d she said. A public-listed CPO player\u2019s executive said his management team understood that the new policy was necessary to be implemented. \u201cIt is short-term pain for long-term gain, as it will ultimately promote biodiesel demand and drive up CPO prices,\u201d he said.

They want to know what in it has attracted the veteran investor who is famed for taking up key stakes in lesser-known companies. While Imaspro managing director Tong Chin Hen claims to be unaware of why the company is subject to Yu\u2019s sudden interest, he points out that the local pesticide maker exports to the EU as its products are compliant with European requirements. \u201cWe are the only Malaysian producer whose products are\u00a0 \u2018proven equivalent\u2019 in the EU, which allows us to sell to its members. The pesticide registration process is long and comprehensive and as tightly regulated as pharmaceutical drugs,\u201d he tells The Edge in a telephone interview. \u00a0 \u201cOur products are registered in many countries. Because of my background and with networking, we are very strong in Eastern Europe,\u201d he says, adding that Imaspro has traditionally been very active in this region. Tong adds that Imaspro\u2019s strong ties with communist countries like Cuba has enabled it to gain entry into them. The company has 277 product registrations globally. In the financial year ended June 30, 2014, local sales accounted for about 45% of its revenue while 55% came from overseas. Imaspro (fundamental: 1.45; valuation: 0.6) is in the business of manufacturing and distributing pesticides, including herbicides, insecticides and fungicides, as well as related agrochemicals. Besides its EU certification, perhaps Yu also likes the company\u2019s balance sheet, which showed net cash of RM51.3 million or 64 sen per share and zero borrowings as at Dec 31, 2014. Little-traded Imaspro saw its volume skyrocket to 1.3 million compared with barely 200,000 shares a day in the past. The surge in interest sent up the company\u2019s share price to an all-time high of RM1.95 on March 25. However, it had retreated to RM1.74 by last Friday. Imaspro is trading at a price-earnings ratio of 16.4 times and has a market capitalisation of RM142.4 million. Yu, who is YNH Property Bhd chairman and executive director, is now the second largest shareholder in Imaspro with a 12.38% stake. His close associate, Chan Weng Fui, has also emerged as a substantial shareholder with 5.49% equity interest or 4.39 million shares. Chan is known to have worked closely with Yu in past transactions, the most notable of which are Rapid Synergy Bhd and Pan Malaysia Holdings Bhd \u2014 companies in which the latter has substantial interests. Tong remains the single largest shareholder of Imaspro with a 42.43% stake or 33.95 million shares through Swiss Revenue Sdn Bhd. He says Imaspro plans to be more aggressive in the local market after successfully securing a tender recently to supply herbicides to Sime Darby Plantation Sdn Bhd, although he notes that the contract is \u201cnot much\u201d. \u201cWe have not been actively involved in (tendering for projects) locally as we have been concentrating on overseas market growth. But we want to have a more aggressive policy on local plantations going forward,\u201d says Tong, adding that management believes a stronger focus on the local plantation business would be worthwhile for Imaspro. He says Imaspro has come to a stage where its daily operations are on \u201cauto cruise\u201d. The company\u2019s net profit jumped from RM5.1 million in FY2012 to RM9.1 million in FY2014 but declined 10% to RM4.28 million in calendar year 2014. This was attributed to a lower margin caused by the fluctuating prices of its main raw material \u2014 glyphosate technical. In the second quarter ended Dec 31, 2014 (2QFY2015), Imaspro\u2019s net profit fell to RM2.44 million from RM2.64 million in the previous corresponding period while revenue dropped to RM25.36 million from RM27.97 million. Glyphosate is the most widely used agrochemical in the world. More than 50% of Imaspro\u2019s revenue is derived from glyphosate-related products, according to Imaspro\u2019s 2014 annual report. \u201cWhile the group purchasing policy keeps the procurement cycle to the shortest possible, we were nevertheless impacted by these widely fluctuating prices of glyphosate technical,\u201d it says, noting that the price of glyphosate technical went on a roller-coaster ride last year. CIMB Investment Bank\u2019s head of retail research for equities, Kong Seh Siang, comments that should the raw material\u2019s price drop further, Imaspro may have to write down more of its inventories. He says glyphosate prices have continued to weaken \u2014 from between US$4 and US$4.20 per kilogramme in 1QFY2015 to US$3.50 at present. Imaspro\u2019s lower revenue in the first half of FY2015 ended Dec 31, 2014, was due to slower replanting of crops on subdued global commodity prices globally, Kong points out. Revenue decreased 11% to RM44.14 million from RM49.62 million a year ago in both the local and export segments, \u201cThe weak outlook for commodity prices remains a banana skin here as planters may choose to defer purchases or even switch to cheaper pesticides in the near future,\u201d says Kong. \u00a0 Crude palm oil prices had fallen 18.24% to RM2,156 per metric ton (MT) last Thursday from RM2,637 a year ago. Most research houses are \u201cneutral\u201d on the plantation sector with CPO price forecasts for this year ranging from about RM2,100 to RM2,700.

Its market capitalisation has doubled from RM28 billion in 2007, just ahead of the merger, to some RM55 billion today. It made some notable acquisitions during this period, including its 40% stake in the iconic Battersea Power Station site. It also partnered Ramsay Health Care to expand into another consumer stronghold and sold its oil and gas business. Now, investors are keeping watch on when Sime Darby will revive the planned spinoff of its motor unit that has been postponed to the second half of calendar year 2015. There\u2019s also a second reason for investors keeping their eyes peeled \u2014 the conglomerate may once again be taking the lead in another mega merger to grow even bigger in the property business. Just last month, following the release of its results for the first half of the financial year ending June 30, 2015, CIMB Research regional plantation analyst Ivy Ng, among other analysts, tells clients in a note that Sime Darby\u2019s weaker earnings \u201care likely to be partially offset by potential acquisitions and the planned listing of certain key businesses\u201d. For FY2014 ended June 30, its motor business contributed 15% to earnings while real estate accounted for 14%. As the world\u2019s third largest dealer of Caterpillar heavy machinery, Sime Darby\u2019s industrial segment is also sizeable, accounting for some 24% of group profits. Its core plantation business remains the group\u2019s largest earnings contributor at 45% last year and it was not too long ago that its strength helped keep the group profitable when some of its other businesses suffered losses. For its latest 2Q numbers, however, Sime Darby\u2019s plantation and industrial businesses \u2014 its two largest contributing core segments \u2014 recorded a 46% and 53% year-on-year slump in earnings before interest and tax. Apart from Sime Darby posting its weakest industrial earnings since the 2008 merger and getting a lower average selling price for its crude palm oil (CPO) of RM2,154 per tonne for 1HFY2015, CIMB\u2019s Ng also notes that Sime\u2019s 2Q fresh fruit bunches (FFB) output fell 15% y-o-y in 2QFY15 and 6% in 1HFY2015 instead of growing 5% in line with management\u2019s guidance. Sime Darby attributed this to poor weather, a shift in cropping patterns and higher planting activity. It now expects flattish FFB output for FY2015 and CPO prices to range between RM2,300 and RM2,500 per tonne between March and June this year. Experts at the recent Palm and Laurics Oil Conference 2015 in Kuala Lumpur projected prices to average between RM1,940 and RM2,500 per tonne for 2015, with the strength of demand for biodiesel being the most influential factor. That\u2019s still not too shabby given that Sime Darby president and group CEO Tan Sri Mohd Bakke Salleh says costs for large players like itself range from RM1,300 to RM1,500 per tonne. This puts gross margins at over 33% if CPO prices were to hover around RM2,000 per tonne. \u201cThe cyclical nature of the industry is not something we are unfamiliar with. If you look at why prices move so rapidly, it comes down to basic demand and supply. Whatever the underlying causes \u2014 weather, disease, demand created by new markets like biodiesel \u2014 price is a factor of demand and supply. In the shorter term, current prices will affect higher-cost, less efficient and smaller players. In the longer term, the prices will find their equilibrium, as will the industry,\u201d Bakke tells The Edge in an interview, pointing out that prices would find support from national policies such as Indonesia\u2019s B15 and possibly B20 biodiesel blend. \u201cThis will mop up a lot of supply from the world\u2019s largest exporter of the oil for domestic consumption,\u201d he says. To be sure, the strength of Sime Darby\u2019s balance sheet during the challenging time of lower CPO prices means that it is better positioned to be a purchaser should smaller operators throw in the towel. Yet, the verdict is split on whether Sime Darby paid a good price for its recently completed purchase of New Britain Palm Oil Ltd. Sime Darby is also not yet on top of the game in some areas, perhaps due to its size. Analysts point out that smaller planters such as United Plantations Bhd achieve higher oil extraction rates (OER) and better FFB yield per hectare (yield/ha). While Sime Darby\u2019s group OER rose from 21.73% in 1HFY2014 to 21.8% in 1HFY2015, this is still below United Plantations\u2019 22.5% in FY2013 and 22.77% in FY2014. During the same period, United Plantations\u2019 FFB yield/ha rose from 20.83 tonnes in 2013 to 21.4 tonnes in 2014. In its latest 1HFY15 earnings briefing, Sime Darby said its group FFB yield/ha fell in 1HFY2015, something which it attributed to higher replanting activity that resulted in the increase of immature hectarage, a shift in cropping trends, prolonged drought in the first half of 2014 as well as the impact of floods at the end of 2014. These are all valid reasons but observers reckon more should be done to ensure that numbers from its plantations business are a lot better. In this regard, Sime Darby has indeed come up with a game plan. Bakke says a number of measures have already been implemented to vigorously manage costs. \u201cEven our capex has been reviewed and we have halved our budgeted capex from RM7.4 billion to RM3.7 billion for the year.\u201d \u201cOn the productivity and revenue side, whatever measures that are humanly possible are being worked on today \u2014 increasing revenue or ensuring we do not lose yields.\u201d Pending results in this area, analysts and investors are looking out for a non-plantation catalyst from the group to boost sentiment on the stock. \u00a0 This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on March 30 - April 5, 2015."}, "216": {"date_posted": "24/4/2015", "title": "Trimming NBPOL stake the next step", "article": "  NEW Britain Palm Oil Ltd (NBPOL) came full circle when it returned to the Sime Darby fold earlier this year. \u201cAs progression of time would have it, the event today essentially marks a homecoming or a reunion for the two companies that essentially share the same origin and history,\u201d Datuk Henry Sackville Barlow, chairman of NBPOL, said in his address on March 2 in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, to mark the completion of the acquisition. Sime Darby managed to secure 98.8% in NBPOL after the close of its general offer. On March 24, it said it will make a compulsory acquisition of the remaining shares in NBPOL, after which the company will automatically be removed from the Port Moresby Stock Exchange. But the plan is to eventually relist NBPOL. In an interview with The Edge, Sime Darby Bhd president and group chief executive Tan Sri Mohd Bakke Salleh says the next step will be to bring in a strategic investor to reduce its shareholding in NBPOL. \u201cWe are going to sit down with the authorities in PNG to discuss how their institutions would like to be a part of us. At the same time, we are going to look for strategic investors outside Malaysia and outside PNG \u2014 they could come from the ranks of other plantation companies, institutions or sovereign funds \u2014 to reduce our shareholding (in NBPOL).\u201d In fact, Bakke says the move to bring in an international investor is being worked on almost immediately. \u201cThe PNG side will take some time but on the strategic investor, we have started already and at the right time, we will release the name.\u201d While no time frame has been set by the board, Bakke says finding a strategic investor is being worked on as a matter of urgency. \u201cFirst of all, we have to sit down and discuss with the other side the benefits of them putting their money in NBPOL and so on.\u201d A bit of history to put things in perspective: NBPOL was established in 1966 by Harrisons & Crosfield,which is one of the three founding companies that eventually became the Sime Darby of today. NBPOL started as a smallholder scheme, a joint venture between H&C and the PNG government. The first scheme was set up at Hoskins in PNG, which was considered a pilot initiative back then. Since then, NBPOL has morphed into the largest plantation player in PNG with a landbank of 135,000ha as well as 12 oil mills, two refineries, a special fractionation plant and a bakery fats plant in the UK. In 1996, the PNG government divested its stake to Kulim (M) Bhd, whose stake Sime Darby eventually acquired as well as the rest of the NBPOL shares via a general offer. The acquisition was completed on March 2 this year, Sime Darby\u2019s largest since its mega merger in 2007. Most analysts view the acquisition positively, noting that NBPOL is one of the more efficient players in the industry. \u201cWe believe the earnings accretive deal will contribute about 4% to 5% to the group\u2019s earnings,\u201d opines Public Investment Bank in a report. Moody\u2019s concurs, noting that the acquisition would widen Sime Darby\u2019s competitive advantage in the upstream plantation segment. \u201cSime Darby is the world\u2019s largest upstream crude palm oil producer. The acquisition would increase its planted area by 15%. By comparison, the next largest are Felda Global Ventures and Golden Agri-Resources,\u201d it says in a report. NBPOL will add 135,000ha to Sime Darby\u2019s landbank, bringing the total to almost one million hectares spread over five countries. NBPOL, Moody\u2019s adds, will enhance Sime Darby\u2019s European sales channel, given that its 300,000 tons per annum (tpa) refinery in Liverpool is fully certified by the Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). This complements Sime Darby\u2019s existing 450,000 tpa refinery in the Netherlands. NBPOL\u2019s yields are above industry average. It recorded a fresh fruit bunch yield of 21.7MT/ha in 2013, which was higher than that of Sime Darby (19.9MT/ha) and other large players. Sime Darby will be forking out RM5.85 billion for NBPOL, or \u00a37.15 per share. This is 1.28 times net tangible asset value (NTAV) and at an 80% premium to the market price at the time. Including assumed debt of RM850 million in NBPOL\u2019s balance sheet, the cost would total RM6.47 billion, notes Moody\u2019s. Is this on the expensive side? Views are mixed. Some analysts feel that at 1.28 times NTAV, the price is justified given the scarcity of such landbank and the fact that PNG is a much better location for expansion compared with Africa. Others view the valuation as expensive, more so when commodity prices are in a down cycle and plantation companies are feeling the impact on their bottom line. NBPOL, in particular, saw a sharp fall in its earnings in FY2011, FY2012 and FY2013. In FY2010, it recorded a net profit of US$266.4 million but this plunged to just US$66.4 million in FY2011. Earnings fell to a mere US$1.6 million in FY2012 before recovering to US$50.1 million in FY2013 and US$68.6 million in FY2014. Bakke, however, is confident that NBPOL will get back on its growth path. \u201cNBPOL\u2019s performance has been strong and shown fairly consistent growth in the recent past. The temporary setback in earnings is in line with extreme weather conditions that affected the industry and the efforts to rehabilitate plantation assets following the acquisition of Cargill estates in PNG,\u201d he says. Bakke believes what is more important is that NBPOL should not be evaluated as a standalone company but as part of the bigger Sime Darby family. \u201cTogether, both NBPOL and Sime Darby are now on a much sounder platform for growth. I have no doubts about that.\u201d Based on a funding mix of 80% debt and 20% cash, Moody\u2019s says this could result in Sime Darby\u2019s gross leverage reaching 2.6 times to 2.9 times after the transaction. \u201cSuch a range would be too high for its current A3 rating,\u201d it notes. Indeed, a view is that raising gearing at this time may not be prudent, given current market conditions (falling CPO prices and slowing economic growth). But Bakke believes that Sime Darby\u2019s new gearing level is not one that creates an untenable situation that is risky for the group\u2019s business. He explains: \u201cAs at the end of this financial year, we expect our gross gearing ratio to be about 62% to 63%; this is all right by industry standards. It is not above 1.0, which will be cause for concern. Bear in mind that this gearing ratio is calculated on the basis that all our plantation assets are reflected at cost. We have not revalued our assets. So, if we do a revaluation, there will be an improvement in equity value.\u201d Furthermore, Sime Darby will pare down its borrowings. \u201cThe deal has happened and what is important now is to identify the means to bring down the gearing, and we will find a solution,\u201d he says. Initiatives have already been started to pare down the bonds, and Sime Darby is working hard to improve free cash flow in its business, he adds. \u201cIn terms of listing our motor business, it is a question of timing; it will give us the source to reduce our borrowings.\u201d For some years now, Sime Darby has been looking to expand its plantation landbank. Today, apart from PNG, its plantations span Indonesia, Malaysia and Liberia. According to Bakke, increasing its plantation hectarage in PNG is part of Sime Darby\u2019s plan further down the road, the expansion made easier with the acquisition of NBPOL. \u2014 By Anna Taing  This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on March 30 - April 5, 2015."}, "217": {"date_posted": "24/4/2015", "title": "Keeping Sime on an even keel", "article": " \nIT wasn\u2019t the best of times at Sime Darby Group when Tan Sri Mohd Bakke Salleh was parachuted in as president and group CEO on July 15, 2010. The group had been going through a period of turbulence since late 2009, when news began to surface that all was not well in its Energy and Utilities Division. By the middle of 2010, things had come to a head; the then president and group CEO Datuk Seri Ahmad Zubir Murshid was asked to go on leave. By then, the E&U division was deeply in the red. In FY2009/10, this division reported an operating loss of RM1.8 billion, according to Sime Darby\u2019s 2010 annual report. At the group level, FY2010 net profit shrank to RM726.8 million from RM2.28 billion in FY2009. It was during these troubled times that Bakke took the helm and his immediate mandate was to put the house in order. This meant making many hard and unpopular decisions that would not sit well with some quarters. According to insiders, Bakke braved the elements and did what needed to be done, including streamlining group operations and disposing of the E&U division, which had been with the group for 25 years. Another daunting task was to drive the group\u2019s plans through following the mega-merger that resulted in Sime Darby becoming the world\u2019s largest plantation company in 2007. The task was made all the more difficult because almost all the key people involved in the 2007 merger had left. All that is now water under the bridge. Today, Sime Darby is back on an even keel. There is no let-up for Bakke, though. He is once again being challenged, this time by an operating environment that is roiled by falling commodity prices and a slower-than-expected recovery in global growth. Indeed, going by the earnings performance in the first half of FY2015, Sime Darby is unlikely to meet the full-year forecast of RM2.5 billion. The Edge sat down with Bakke for an interview when he was in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, to attend an event to mark the completion of Sime Darby\u2019s acquisition of New Britain Palm Oil Ltd (NBPOL) on March 2. This is his first media interview on his five-year journey, the challenges and what more is to come since taking up the reins of the company in 2010. \u201cWhen I first joined Sime Darby, the priority then was to put the group on a much stronger footing. Having done that, we\u2019ve put in place a five-year strategy to realise the full potential of our core businesses and achieve leadership positions,\u201d says Bakke. How much traction has that gained? \u201cWe\u2019re on the right track, but the global environment has been challenging, and we\u2019ve had to refine our business strategies to address the consolidation of the mining industry in Australia, credit tightening and stricter regulations in the motor and property businesses (in Malaysia), for example,\u201d says Bakke. What have been his biggest challenges in the last five years? \u201cThere have been many but the main one would be the weak commodity prices. Our two biggest divisions \u2014 plantations and industrial \u2014 are facing lower CPO (crude palm oil) and coal prices ... another key challenge is identifying the right opportunities when times are difficult.\u201d Even so, Bakke takes such challenges in his stride. \u201cChallenges will always be there in a business environment that is dynamic. Whenever something crops up, we will have to work out a response or solution to the problem. That\u2019s what business is all about.\u201d  The following is an excerpt of the interview. The Edge: What more, in your view, could be done to unlock value for Sime Darby\u2019s shareholders?Tan Sri Mohd Bakke Salleh: Sime Darby is always evaluating opportunities to create more value for shareholders but we are also mindful of doing them at the right time. We will continue to improve our operational efficiencies and pursue strategic portfolio growth. The latter could be anything from acquisitions and initial public offerings to strategic alliances. We could not achieve anything of the above without people. Thus, we have in place our talent development and human capital management to ensure we have the best personnel to execute the strategies. Sime Darby\u2019s ops were rationalised into five divisions under your stewardship. Some of these units have potential for listing. You have talked about the motor sector IPO. What about the property division, which has come under a lot of speculation pertaining to a possible merger with other PNB (Permodalan Nasional Bhd) property arms?\nOur focus is to realise the full potential of our property business. We are working towards diversifying our earnings base by developing commercial properties with recurring income potential and in terms of geography. As for strategic alliances, the Battersea project is a good example of the opportunities that are out there. As for plans that are being reported in the media, we cannot comment on speculation. What have been the biggest challenges for you in the last five years?\nThere have been many but the main one would be weak commodity prices. Our two biggest divisions \u2014 plantation and industrial \u2014 are facing lower CPO and coal prices respectively. Having said that, we expanded to Liberia in 2009 and acquired Bucyrus in 2011, which will position us well when the markets turn around. Another key challenge is identifying the right opportunities when times are difficult. Going by your latest financial results, the downturn in commodity prices and a tough economic environment are beginning to bite. How are you strategising to ride out this period?\nWe have been sharing this with the market. Today, we have implemented a number of measures to vigorously manage our costs, even our capex has been reviewed and we have halved our budgeted capex from RM7.4 billion to RM3.7 billion for the year (for FY2015) (excluding the NBPOL acquisition). As for operating costs, we have identified areas where we have to reduce the expenditure and only incur expenditure if it is deemed necessary. On the productivity side and revenue, whatever measures that are humanly possible are being worked on today: increasing revenue or ensuring that we do not lose on yields. Yields are dependent on a number of factors, for example the age of the palms is important, the weather and also the human touch, the manuring programmes, the planting materials. Weather indeed is an important factor. On the human measures, it is about improving agronomic practices and competence. One of the benefits I am looking forward to from this exercise (the acquisition of NBPOL) is the cross fertilisation of agro management practices. Sime Darby may miss the RM2.5 billion profit KPI?\nI think you guys are drawing conclusions about it. We achieved 38% of our target (for the first half) but even the KPI that we set was done based on a number of assumptions. But if the actual scenario differs from what was assumed \u2014 obviously, that will have an impact but we will try to mitigate the impact of the new scenarios with other measures towards meeting the KPI. Are you worried about the impact of a weakening ringgit?\nThe weakening ringgit helped our CPO exports but it is not good for the auto business. Having said that, the good thing is that 50% of our revenue comes from overseas business. Sime Darby\u2019s yield trend is flat or even falling. Why?\nToday, we have increased the percentage of replanting. The rule of thumb is that if you assume a 25-year age of palms cycle, it means that every year, you need to set aside 4% for replanting, but we decided to increase that, especially for Indonesia. That will also pull down our yields. In terms of areas affected by tree stress and weather-related factors, in Indonesia, the effects are still there. Then in Malaysia, in the first six months of last year, we had dry weather. Today, we are not getting the targeted yields. As for human contribution, that is the agronomic practices. We are doing what is considered \u2018best in class\u2019 practices, in terms of loose fruit collection, making sure crop recovery is 100%, the waiting period is reduced \u2014 all these things are in place. We have implemented a system in head office that can monitor the activities of our estates. We look at the screen to see what\u2019s happening on the ground, we have given out this gadget to our conductors, estate managers. We know what they have done for the day, on the basis of extracting the most from the use of technology. So, we still have scope for improvement but whatever is considered to be useful tools to enhance performance, we have already adopted them. And we will continue to improve on this. When do you expect to see an upturn in yield performance?\nI think by next year, when we report our next financial results, it has to be higher than what we will eventually achieve this year. This is something being worked on all the time by getting input from agronomists and so on, changing and tweaking our practices. Water management is another area. In estates where we are able to roll out good water management facilities, we have observed an improvement in yields. Oil palm estates live on water. To increase coverage of our water management support system for the entire group will be onerous from a cost perspective because you need to spend money to set up a watering system. It is not cheap. To get the full impact and desired effect, the estimate is RM8,000 to RM10,000 per hectare. In the long run, there will be a significant impact on yields. These measures are being looked at, reviewed and tried on a pilot basis in a few of our estates. Ideally, water management infrastructure should be extended to all our estates but this is financially burdensome.\nThe other thing to improve productivity is to replant with new planting materials that will give us better yields. We have planting materials that can give us oil yields of anything between 8 and 12 tonnes per hectare ... but now we are only enjoying around five tonnes per hectare. How long do you expect this challenging period to continue?\nThe CPO price today is around RM2,300. Even if it stays at around this level, we will continue to make reasonable profits. But if it firms up to RM2,400 to RM2,500, the better for us. As for our property business, 60% to 75% of our products are below RM700,000 in terms of pricing. We have seen strong take-up rates in our recent launches, such as Nafiri 2 in Bandar Bukit Raja, Aralia in Elmina East and Azalea in Nilai Impian. We expect demand for properties to remain robust, especially among genuine buyers looking for long-term value appreciation and rental income. This is where demand is still resilient. As for the auto business, there are new challenges, like the impact of forex on CBUs (completely built-up units) and overlapping of the sales tax with GST (Goods and Services Tax). \u00a0 Once the market digests this, the motor business will continue to grow. We see that every year \u2014 there has been an increase in total industry volume, 2% growth on average. In Singapore, the outlook is improving compared with a year ago. China is the largest market in the world, we cannot ignore it, all the auto players are represented there. At a recent conference on the outlook for CPO, a widely held view was that prices could go below RM2,000 to about RM1,800. How would this change the industry dynamics?\nPalm oil is a commodity and like all other commodities, prices are cyclical. Just a few years ago, RM2,500 to RM3,000 was considered the \u2018normal\u2019 range for prices. Not that long ago, in 2008, prices touched RM4,203 but in 2001, just seven years before that, prices hit a low of RM625. The cyclical nature of the industry is not something we are unfamiliar with. If you look at why prices move so rapidly, it comes down to basic demand and supply. Whatever the underlying causes \u2014 weather, disease, demand created by a new market like biodiesel \u2014 price is a factor of demand and supply. In the shorter term, current prices will affect higher cost, less efficient and smaller players. In the longer term, the prices will find their equilibrium, as will the industry. Today, prices are hovering just above RM2,000. Costs, for larger players like us, range from about RM1,300 to RM1,500 a tonne. But for smaller players, costs can be higher, which means their profit margins will be squeezed. It is at times such as these that good assets can become available as those who had higher entry costs or less holding power seek to exit the industry. We have seen abandoned plantations, smallholders who have to resort to other ways of earning a living not harvesting their trees and cost-cutting measures that involve the reduction of fertiliser application. All of these will result in reduced production and you will start seeing stock levels come off within 6 to 12 months. Furthermore, there is the additional consideration that CPO is an edible oil and a perfect substitute for other edible oils, such as soy, corn and rapeseed. When edible oil prices dip to unattractive levels, farmers of annual crops shift to other crops, as they have in the past, which will again affect demand. Finally, there are national policies that we should also consider. Indonesia has just announced a biodiesel blend of B15. It is looking at the possibility of B20. This will mop up a lot of supply from the world\u2019s largest exporter of the oil for domestic consumption.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Africa was a new frontier for Sime Darby. How much traction has Liberia gained? How big a setback was the Ebola outbreak?\nWe believe that we\u2019ve made considerable progress, although planting 10,000ha since 2010 is slower relative to what we\u2019re used to in Asia. The Ebola outbreak was unfortunate because we were making strides in our refined FPIC (free, prior and informed consent) process. The good news is that new Ebola cases have dwindled and we expect to resume full operations this year. As a long-term investor, we still believe in the potential of Africa as the new frontier for oil palm. What about Indonesia? There was talk that Sime Darby is restructuring its Indonesian assets. How much traction has the restructuring gained?\nAs mentioned before in our media briefings, we are still examining the options and we will make an announcement at the appropriate time. On the acquisition of NBPOL There is a view that given current market conditions, the price that Sime Darby paid for NBPOL was on the expensive side?\nWe believe we have paid a fair market price.\u00a0The price expectation of a successful acquisition following the failed Kulim bid was between \u00a36.50 and \u00a37 per share. We paid \u00a37.15 per share, which was at a slight premium to that price. But I think this price is acceptable, given the scarcity of suitable landbank and the high costs and risks associated with greenfield developments. We see this as a rare opportunity that should not be missed. In return for the premium, we are getting quality brownfield assets, that is ~135,000ha of landbank with ~81,500ha planted that are fully RSPO certified. Besides oil palm, NBPOL is also involved in beef, sugar and seed production. Furthermore, Sime Darby sees this acquisition as the gateway to future expansion within and outside PNG. Hence, we believe the quality of the assets justifies the price. What is clearly visible to the market is the strength of NBPOL\u2019s upstream business.\u00a0However, for Sime Darby, the downstream business is the hidden jewel in NBPOL.\u00a0It has succeeded in commanding a price premium for its sustainable palm products.\nI think not every plantation player will be able to appreciate NBPOL\u2019s strengths. Sime Darby and NBPOL\u2019s strengths in the production of sustainable palm oil represent not only our shared business practices and beliefs but also a platform to do greater things together across the value chain. Can you talk about Sime Darby\u2019s plans to tap NBPOL\u2019s strengths?\nAs we work towards integrating operations, there will be lots of opportunities for us to cross fertilise, in areas where we hope to generate benefits \u2014 which will have an impact on Sime Darby\u2019s other operations. They will also benefit from our contributions. It\u2019s a synergistic outcome \u2014 the synergy achieved by both parties. From NBPOL\u2019s perspective, how will it benefit?\nFor a start, it is going to be part of a company with a bigger balance sheet now. Future expansion will be driven by Sime Darby\u2019s balance sheet. We are already looking at increasing the landbank and in PNG alone, we can easily increase it by 20,000ha. These are areas that have already been identified. These are greenfields that can be developed into oil palm estates. They will not be problematic as far as sustainability issues are concerned because they comply with the principles. Why did it take Sime Darby so long to come into PNG?\nWe first came here in 2009 and there were subsequent visits but to secure sizeable tracts of land was a challenge. We could not find anything suitable. Other companies were not able to establish a presence here as well. Interestingly enough, way back in 2012, I sat down with Kulim\u2019s directors to negotiate an offer to take over their block and do a GO, and they asked for \u00a39. We backed off. Later, we found out from RHB Bank that it was keen to dispose of its shareholding after it could not increase its stake from 49% to about 65%. When RHB contacted us, we said, fine, did all the legwork and took part in a tender exercise. Of course, when you are involved in such an exercise, it\u2019s not easy because you have to try to read the minds of other bidders. If it is a one-on-one deal, it\u2019s take it or leave it. But in a tender exercise, especially in the field that has other established companies with deep pockets, the tender price has to be in an attractive range. It was based on a combination of factors \u2014 looking at the financial impact on our balance sheet, how our earnings will improve and quantifying the indirect impact of the acquisition. That is the financial benefits that will accrue to us with cross fertilisation of the two companies. The (tender) price (was one) that gave us the best opportunity and a likely probability of winning the bid. If NBPOL is good, why did Kulim sell?\nI cannot answer for the company but from what little I know about the decision to sell, it could not increase its stake. On what exchange rate is the amount that Sime Darby has to pay for NBPOL based on, given that the ringgit is weakening?\nBefore we made payments, we had already bought sterling forward ... the average rate was RM5.50. The rate that prevailed in June last year was around RM5.40 to RM5.45, then it came down to RM5.41 to RM5.42 and then moved up to RM5.50. Now, it is RM5.60. The moment we decided that our bid was successful, we decided that the right thing to do was to lock in the exchange rate. We did not cover everything because we did it in stages. Your view on fund raising now?\nAs far as we are concerned, the lines were secured last October, so now it is just making payments. At the end of the financial year, we expect our gross gearing ratio to be about 62% to 63%; this is still all right by industry standards, it is not above one, which will be a cause for concern. Bear in mind that this gearing ratio is calculated on the basis that all our plantation assets are reflected at cost. We have not revalued our assets; so if we do a revaluation, there will be an improvement in equity value. Have you set KPIs for NBPOL?\nWe will discuss this at our board meeting; we will talk about a five- year plan. All along, it was a standalone company, now it is part of the Sime Darby family. The way it rolls out its business will need to move in harmony with Sime Darby\u2019s aspiration and strategy roadmap. Nick Thompson, in his speech, alluded that NBPOL had done well in the past because management was given authority and the freedom to act and so on. How far will this continue?\nThis is the beginning of a new phase, a journey that will see exciting things and developments. The immediate thing that has come out of this acquisition is that we will be appointing Simon Lord, who is the head of sustainability, as head of Sime Darby\u2019s group sustainability. Simon is acknowledged as one of the top sustainability guys in the market. We hope that by having him on board, our sustainability standards will be further improved. Enhancing our sustainability profile translates into financial benefits. One of NBPOL\u2019s key strengths is sustainability value and it produces around half a million tonnes while we have been producing 2.4 million to 2.5 million tonnes. So, you see the impact on our production, it is enormous. There are other things in the pipeline which I cannot share with you today, where an acquisition will open doors for other favourable developments. Is it being explored?\nYes.

Property developer Sunsuria Bhd has proposed to buy the remaining 50% stake it does not own in Sime Darby Sunsuria Development Sdn Bhd (SDSD), a joint-venture with Sime Darby (Sungai Kapar) Sdn Bhd, for RM173.4 million, cash. SDSD is a development company incorporated to undertake the Suria Serenia development on a 331.27 acres land located at Putrajaya South, which surrounds the upcoming Xiamen University Malaysia Campus. In a statement to Bursa Malaysia today, Sunsuria (fundamental: 2.5; valuation: 0.8) said it will have full control of SDSD, subsequent to the corporate exercise, which is expected to be completed by second quarter of 2015. AEON Credit Service (M) Bhd\u2019s net profit jumped 15.8% to RM55.4 million in the fourth quarter ended Feb 20, 2015 (4QFY15), from RM47.8 million in the previous corresponding quarter. Revenue leapt 20.4% to RM226.37 million, from RM187.99 million previously. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, AEON Credit attributed the improvements to growth in transaction, financing volume and auto financing operations. Cumulatively, AEON Credit\u2019s FY15 net profit climbed 18.3% to RM207.4 million, from RM175.4 million in the previous year; while revenue surged 26.8% to RM852.8 million, from RM672.8 million previously. Going forward, AEON Credit expects to maintain its current performance in the financial year ending Feb 29, 2016, based on implementation of its business plan. Property developer IGB Corp Bhd has proposed to sell a small tract measuring 0.03 acre in Gombak, Selangor, for RM62.8 million to Ecofirst Consolidated Bhd (ECB), which is also involved in property development. In an announcement to Bursa, IGB (fundamental: 1.2; valuation: 2.2) said Harta Villa Sdn Bhd (HVSB) had today entered into an option agreement with EcoFirst Development Sdn Bhd (EDSB) \u2014 a wholly-owned unit of ECB (fundamental: 0.7; valuation: 0.5) \u2014 for the right to purchase the land. HVSB is a wholly-owned unit of Tan & Tan Developments Bhd, which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of IGB. The proposed sale does not require the approval of IGB shareholders, but it is conditional upon the approval of ECB shareholders. IGB said the disposal of the land represented an \u2018opportune time\u2019 to realise a gain from its investment, given the significant appreciation in the value of the land since it was first acquired in 1994 at RM36 million. Assuming the approval from ECB shareholders is received, IGB is expected to register a gain on disposal after tax of RM17.7 million. Engineering solutions provider Emas Kiara Industries Bhd\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary Kiaratex Export Pte Ltd has been awarded a sub-contract work at Singapore\u2019s Changi Airport for S$8.67 million (equivalent to RM23.25 million). In a filing, Emas Kiara (fundamental: 1.65; valuation:0.9) said Kiaratex has entered into a sub-contract agreement with Penta Ocean Consctruction-Civil Tech Joint Venture (POC-CT JV) for the installation of prefabricated Vertical Drain Works (PVD) and PVD surcharge trial panel works for Singapore's Changi Airport for the said sum, excluding goods and services tax (GST). POC-CT JV is the main contractor for the land preparation works for Changi Airport Development, appointed by the Ministry of Transport, Singapore.\n\u00a0\nGlove manufacturing giant Top Glove Corp Bhd has offered to acquire a 1.5 acre plot of commercial land in Bukit Raja, Selangor, from Century Total Logistics Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Century Logistics Holdings Bhd, for RM20.26 million. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, Top Glove (fundamental: 2.5; valuation: 1.3) said the deal was offered through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Top Glove Properties Sdn Bhd. Top Glove also said the sales and purchase agreement for the proposed acquisition is expected to be signed within 21 days from the date of signing acceptance by the vendor (April 17, 2015). Telecommunication software player Nexgram Holdings Bhd announced its wholly-owned subsidiary Nextnation Network Sdn Bhd had signed a share sale agreement with Power Solution Group Ltd to acquire 186,000 shares or 18.6% stake in Godynamic Investments Ltd for RM18.53 million cash. The acquisition will increase Nextnation\u2019s stake in Godynamic to 69.6%, from 51% currently. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia this evening, Nexgram (fundamental: 2.1; valuation: 1.7) said the acquisition of the stake was based on the future prospects and potential earnings of Godynamic, stemming from the service agreement that its 84%-owned subsidiary PT Flower Star Media had signed with Small Guard Inc on March 20, 2015. Nexgram, which is controlled by its managing director and chief executive officer Datuk Tey Por Yee who has a 20.13% equity stake, expects to complete the share acquisition in the first quarter of the financial year ending April 30, 2016 (FY16). Nestle Bhd\u2019s net profit grew 2.4% to RM187.9 million in the first quarter ended Mar 31, 2015 (1QFY15), from RM183.5 million in the previous corresponding quarter. Quarterly revenue was nearly flat at RM1.28 billion, up 0.4% from RM1.27 billion previously. Nestle (fundamental: 1.35; valuation: 1.5) told Bursa Malaysia that the improvements were mainly driven by its consumer promotional campaign. The group also admitted lower export sales to affiliated companies had an \u201cimpact\u201d on its overall turnover development. However, against the fourth quarter of last year, the impact was much smaller, indicating a sign of stabilisation. Nestle expects 2015 to be a very challenging year, due to the implementation of the goods & services tax.\n\u00a0Axis Real Estate Investment Trust (Axis REIT) has announced its first interim income distribution of 4.10 sen per unit, or a total of RM22.5 million, for the first quarter ended March 31, 2015 (1QFY15).

Revenue meanwhile grew 14% to RM40.6 million, from RM35.6 million previously. On prospects, Axis REIT (fundamental: 0.9; valuation: 0) said it was optimistic that it would be able to maintain its current performance for FY15. Cargo transportation and freight forwarding service provider See Hup Consolidated Bhd\u2019s wholly-owned unit See Hup Transport Sdn Bhd has entered into a conditional sale and purchase agreement with Loh Gim Ean Holdings Sdn Bhd (LGE) for the proposed disposal of three adjoining lots of development land in Seberang Prai, Penang, for RM17.6 million cash. The three plots of freehold land measure a total of 146,143 sq ft.\u00a0 \u00a0 See Hup (fundamental: 0.75; valuation: 0.9) told Bursa Malaysia that while the land is currently being used as its lorry depot and truck servicing area, it will move these operation to a new area after the disposal. See Hup's share price closed unchanged at RM1.10 today, for a market capitalisation of RM56.25 million. Pioneer local employment portal company Jobstreet Corp Bhd is in no rush to acquire a new core business, chief executive officer Mark Chang said after the group\u2019s extraordinary general meeting. Chang said Jobstreet (fundamental: 1.95; valuation: 2.4) is open to investing in any business sector, but particularly favours new companies, though he did not rule out the possibility of starting up a new job portal. However, he noted the group is adopting a conservative approach and will focus on spending the next two years studying the market, before it decides its future direction. After completing the disposal of its online job portal to Seek Asia Investments Pte Ltd for RM1.89 billion on Nov 20 last year, JobStreet had distributed almost all proceeds of the disposal as a special cash dividend to shareholders at RM2.65 per share. Penang-based Qdos Holdings Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Suiwah Corp Bhd, is investing up to RM35 million to introduce new cutting-edge technology in the local semiconductor industry. Suiwah is an operator for malls and convenience stores in Penang, through the \u2018Sunshine\u2019 and \u2018Suiwah\u2019 brand. In a statement today, Qdos business development director S. Suresh said to-date, the company had invested RM25 million in equipment, manpower and technology transfer activities to develop the new technology in the country. Moving forward, he said there will be another RM10 million investment in this year alone, to manufacture Molded Interconnect Substrates (MIS) circuits. Suresh said the MIS technology enables the production of super fine circuitry that can advance high performance applications \u2014 particularly equipment with 4G, low noise and high frequency requirements. Generic pharmaceutical products maker Hovid Bhd saw Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (KWAP) emerged as its substantial shareholder, after a procurement of five million shares from the open market on April 8. In a filing with the local exchange, Hovid (fundamental: 2.1; valuation: 0.5) said the retirement fund had 38.5 million shares or 5.042% stake in it as at April 8. On April 9, KWAP acquired a further two million shares, increasing its stake in Hovid to 5.3% or 40.5 million shares. \u00a0 Bioalpha Holdings Bhd, which debuted on the ACE Market of Bursa Malaysia last Tuesday (April 14) but saw its share price jump as much as 135% since then, told Bursa today that it was not aware of any unannounced corporate development that may account for the recent price hike in its shares. In a filing to the bourse today, it also said it is not aware of any rumour or report concerning its business or affairs \u2014 or that of its subsidiaries \u2014 that may account for the unsual market activity (UMA). The explanation from the government-controlled health supplement manufacturer came after an UMA query was issued by Bursa earlier in the day, following the recent spike in is share price and volume. The Ministry of Finance Inc owns a controlling 51.4% indirect stake in Bioalpha. Bioalpha\u2019s shares rose as much as 8.5 sen or 22% to 47 sen today. This is a 27 sen or 135% jump from its initial public offering (IPO) share price of 20 sen each. It was last done at 41.5 sen today, after some 193.83 million shares were traded, which gave it a market capitalisation of RM192.3 million.

SDSD was incorporated as a 50:50 joint venture company between Sime Darby Property (Sungai Kapar) Sdn Bhd and Sunsuria\u2019s unit, Sunsuria Gateway Sdn Bhd (SGSB), to undertake a proposed property development project known as SuriaSerenia on a plot of 331.27 acres of freehold land in Putrajaya. In a press statement, Sunsuria (fundamental: 2.5; valuation: 0.8) said it entered into a conditional share purchase agreement with Sime Darby Property for the proposed acquisition today and that the deal is expected to be completed by the second quarter of this year. Meanwhile, Sunsuria said it has acquired the other 50% stake in SDSD through a corporate exercise with SGSB. The property developer had earlier executed a subscription agreement in SGSB for the subscription of RM1 million ordinary shares and RM237 million redeemable preference shares-B in SGSB, which resulted in Sunsuria effectively owning the other 50% interest in SDSD. Following the completion of the conditional share purchase agreement with Sime Darby Property, Sunsuria will assume full control of SDSD, it added. \u201cThis represents a significant milestone for Sunsuria to optimise the value and effective implementation of the development being a smart liveable and sustainable city,\u201d said Sunsuria. Sunsuria said from the proposed subscription of RM238 million in SGSB, RM168.39 million will be utilised to repay all its existing redeemable preference shares-A. Of the RM168.39 million settlement, RM100 million is in the form of new shares to be issued by Sunsuria at an issue price of 98 sen per share. It added RM69.61 million will be retained by Sunsuria Gateway to be utilised for inter-alia working capital purposes, including payment of the remaining unpaid land purchase consideration by SDSD.

This will pave the way for the utility giant to garner a targeted stake of not less than 50% in the port operator, which is deemed strategic to serve its power plants in Seri Manjung, Perak. After a four-hour-long extraordinary general meeting (EGM) held in Ipoh last Friday, Perak Corp CEO Datuk Aminuddin Md Desa told reporters that the resolution for the disposal was successfully passed with 99% voting in support of the sale. The outcome of the poll came as a surprise as there had been some dissenting voices among the minority shareholders on the proposed sale to Tenaga (fundamental: 1.30; valuation: 1.80). Perbadanan Kemajuan Negeri Perak is the single largest shareholder of Perak Corp with equity interest of 52.9% while Sime Darby Property Bhd, a unit of Sime Darby Bhd, holds a 6.12% stake. \u201cToday, we had the EGM and the shareholders voted. And there was no other offer except Tenaga\u2019s. We will communicate with Tenaga that we accept the offer to dispose of our shares [in Integrax] at RM3.25 per share. \u201cWe hope it will be a successful exercise for Tenaga and we hope that it [the 15.74% stake] is enough for Tenaga to win [Integrax],\u201d said Aminuddin, adding that Integrax (fundamental: 1.65; valuation: 1.20) will become stronger under the leadership of the government-linked utility company. In its original plan, Perak Corp was to use all the proceeds from the divestment \u2014 some RM153.86 million \u2014 to fund its projects and partly settle its borrowings. However, after the EGM, Aminuddin said the board will consider the shareholders\u2019 request for a special dividend. Sources close to the deal also tell The Edge that Tenaga is confident of receiving at least 51% acceptance of its takeover offer for Integrax, inclusive of Perak Corp\u2019s 15.74% stake. Tenaga owned a 28.32% stake in Integrax as at March 27, up from 22.12% when it first made the offer in January. With Perak Corp\u2019s acceptance, it has secured a 44.06% stake. Support from Perak Corp was crucial and luckily for Tenaga, the state outfit did not consider an offer from Integrax\u2019s co-founder, Amin Halim Rasip, to buy a 5% stake in the port operator at RM3.50 per share, which was 25 sen more than Tenaga\u2019s offer. After that, Amin commenced legal action to thwart Tenaga\u2019s offer, saying it undervalued Integrax. Amin, who is deputy chairman of Integrax, has a 24.61% stake in the company. Perak Corp has said it is seeking legal advice on the letter of demand dated March 24 sent by Amin\u2019s solicitors. When met at the EGM, Amin expressed his disappointment at the shareholders\u2019 approval of the disposal. \u201cAt the meeting, minority shareholders made various proposals, including the option to wait and seek higher offers and that it should be sold at RM3.66 per share. But Perak Corp decided against it. It is a grave concern that it did not go out to get higher offers.\u201d According to Amin, he and several other \u201cMalaysian partners\u201d are planning to make a voluntary general offer for Integrax. Before the EGM, Amin had proposed an additional resolution to require Perak Corp to invite further offers from Tenaga or any other party to seek a minimum offer of RM3.66 per share. However, his proposal was turned down before the EGM. The company said it could not grant Amin\u2019s request at the EGM last Friday \u201cas the proposed modification and addition of resolution would be tantamount to a new business\u201d. It also noted that for a business to be transacted at an EGM, the shareholders must be given at least 14 days\u2019 notice.

MARC has MARC-1ID and AAAID ratings on the IMTN Programme and ICP, respectively. \u201cMARC\u2019s rating affirmation takes into consideration the challenging operating environment for Sime Darby\u2019s key business segments, mainly plantation and industrial, which have weighed on the group\u2019s earnings,\u201d the firm said. MARC said the affirmed ratings incorporated its expectations that Sime Darby will maintain its financial metrics in line with the current rating bands, following the largely debt-funded acquisition of New Britain Palm Oil Limited (NBPOL) for RM6 billion. \u201cWith an 83:17 financing mix, Sime Darby has added RM5.0 billion to its borrowings, bringing the total pro forma borrowings to RM17.5 billion, from RM11.6 billion at end-December 2014,\u201d MARC explained. This will translate into a debt-equity ratio of 0.58 times for Sime Darby, as compared with 0.4 times at end-December 2014. MARC said it regards the NBPOL purchase as a credit positive, in that it will further strengthen Sime Darby\u2019s commendable global market position in the palm oil industry. Nevertheless, due to current subdued market conditions, MARC expects the challenging prospects for Sime Darby\u2019s plantation division to weigh on group earnings for financial year ending Dec 31, 2015 (FY15), given the division has historically accounted for about 45% of consolidated group pre-tax profits. Notably, Fitch Ratings revised its outlook on Sime Darby\u2019s Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency Issuer Default Ratings to negative, from stable last month.

Sources say a proposal has been put forward to the relevant parties but it is not clear if PNB, Sime and S P Setia are receptive to it as it would be a massive undertaking. PNB has a 51.12% stake in S P Setia (fundamental: 1.4; valuation: 1.2) and a direct 10.06% shareholding in Sime (fundamental: 1.0; valuation: 0.90) with another 36.73% held via Skim Amanah Saham Bumiputera. If the proposal comes to fruition, Sime would have to make a mandatory general offer (MGO) for S P Setia as the 51.12% stake exceeds the MGO trigger point of 33%. It would be a hefty acquisition. Given S P Setia\u2019s market capitalisation of RM8.54 billion as at last Friday, PNB\u2019s 51.12% stake is worth RM4.37 billion. Nevertheless, Sime\u2019s market cap is much larger, at RM57.52 billion. Sources say such a deal is unlikely to be facilitated by a share swap as S P Setia\u2019s minority shareholders may not like exchanging their shares in a property company for those in a conglomerate with diversified businesses such as plantations, automotive and so forth, apart from property. For Sime to fund a cash deal, it could likely resort to a rights issue where PNB could subscribe for its entitlement by utilising the proceeds from S P Setia. While consolidation of PNB\u2019s property portfolio remains the key reason, the motivation for such a deal could be because both Sime and S P Setia are entering into a slow growth phase due to a challenging environment in the plantation and property sectors. In the financial year ended Oct 31, 2014 (FY2014), S P Setia saw its net profit fall 3% to RM405.7 million from RM418.3 million the previous year despite revenue rising 16.8% to RM3.8 billion. Sime, meanwhile, saw its net profit decline to RM938.1 million in the six months ended Dec 31, 2014, from RM1.31 billion previously due mainly to weak commodity prices. Market observers say it makes sense for Sime and S P Setia to merge. They each have a 40% stake in Battersea Power Station Development Co Ltd while the Employees Provident Fund holds the remaining 20%. The Battersea project in London has an estimated gross development value (GDV) of RM50 billion. Datuk Seri Abd Wahab Maskan, managing director of Sime\u2019s unlisted property arm Sime Darby Property Bhd (Sime Property), told The Edge Financial Daily last September that the GDV of Sime Property\u2019s projects could exceed RM100 billion. This excludes its share of the Battersea project\u2019s GDV as well as the development potential of some of Sime\u2019s plantation estates in emerging areas, which could further increase the potential GDV. In terms of property assets, Sime could be one of the largest property players in the country, alongside IOI Properties Group Bhd (GDV: over RM100 billion) and S P Setia Bhd (GDV: RM71 billion). Sime also holds a 21.95% stake worth about RM570.7 million in Penang-based developer Eastern & Oriental Bhd. Rumours about a consolidation or merger of property assets of sorts between Sime and S P Setia are not new. In S P Setia\u2019s case, questions about its direction and leadership have swirled around since the departure of former president and chief executive Tan Sri Liew Kee Sin last April. Liew was synonymous with the S P Setia brand and has set the bar very high for his successor. Lined up to take over his duties were the then chief financial officer Datuk Teow Leong Seng and deputy president and chief operating officer Datuk Voon Tin Yow. They were supposed to stay on until this year but Teow left in mid-2014, followed by Voon in December. Deputy president Datuk Khor Chap Jen has now taken the helm of the company. Sime, meanwhile, needs huge management resources to spur the development of its massive landbank. With plantations being its core business all these years, the group has traditionally focused its management resources on this sector instead of property development. As for PNB, a merger between Sime and S P Setia would enable it to restructure the assets and strengthen the property division\u2019s management, thus paving the way for an even larger property entity to be listed on Bursa Malaysia. It is worth noting that PNB wholly owns I&P Group Sdn Bhd, which was formed in 2009 out of the merger of Island & Peninsular Bhd, Petaling Garden Bhd and Pelangi Bhd. When contacted, Sime Darby says it \u201ccannot comment on speculation\u201d while PNB could not be reached.

The EGM is to let shareholders vote on the proposed sale of the group\u2019s 15.74% stake in Integrax Bhd to Tenaga Nasional Bhd for a total of RM150.31 million or RM3.25 per Integrax share. Perak Corp\u2019s minorities could be unhappy because the board doesn\u2019t plan to distribute any of the sale proceeds to shareholders, but intends to fully utilise them for working capital and repayment of borrowings. What\u2019s more, despite an EGM being convened, minorities don\u2019t have much say because state entity Perak State Development Corp (PKNP) controls some 52.9% of Perak Corp. Since it is not a related-party deal with Tenaga, PKNP alone could vote in favour of Perak Corp selling the Integrax stake. For the proposed sale to go through, Perak Corp needs at least 50% plus one share from shareholders. The indications are that PKNP will support the deal. Perak Corp\u2019s board, with representatives linked to the Perak government, had on Feb 26 announced its decision to recommend that its shareholders accept the revised offer from Tenaga. The initial offer was RM2.75, but it was revised to RM3.25, following the suggestion of Perak Corp to Tenaga. Perak Corp\u2019s minorities may want a higher price from the Integrax deal. In a March 4 statement, M&A Securities, which is acting as an independent adviser to the takeover offer, described the revised offer of RM3.25 as not fair. M&A values each Integrax share at between RM3.60 and RM3.66. The Integrax deal aside, it is worth noting that Perak Corp\u2019s minorities have just had a run-in with PKNP, which tried to privatise Perak Corp at RM3.90 per share via a selective capital reduction exercise late last year. Owning to the objection of the minorities, notably Sime Darby Property Bhd, which owns a 6.12% stake in Perak Corp, PKNP was forced to abort the privatisation exercise, which was said to have undervalued Perak Corp. Back to the Integrax deal, one representative of a minority shareholder group in Perak Corp said, \u201cIt is unfortunate that minorities will not have a say in this stake sale given PKNP\u2019s majority position.\u201d \u201cWith no special dividend at all [from the sale proceeds], a more sceptical shareholder would perceive this as a \u2018punishment\u2019 for minorities for blocking the privatisation exercise [by PKNP last year].\u201d According to Perak Corp\u2019s board, the proposed sale proceeds of RM150.31 million will go towards enhancing the group\u2019s balance sheet, with RM77.69 million to be utilised for working capital, and\u00a0 RM72 million to repay borrowings. The group holds cash of RM107.56 million as at Dec 31, 2014, with total borrowings of RM104.92 million. With the repayment, its debt will come down to RM32.92 million, and cash level increase to some RM186 million. Minus the remaining debt, Perak Corp will have a net cash position of RM153 million, compared with its current market capitalisation of RM307 million at its share price of RM3.03 last Thursday. The proposed sale of the Integrax stake would also enable Perak Corp to book a net gain of RM52.3 million from its investment, hence improving its net asset value per share to as high as RM5.70 from RM5.14 at present. However, this will further widen the discount between its current share price and net asset value per share. In a nutshell, minorities would generally not be in favour of any listed firm keeping all the cash from major divestment exercises for fear of related-party acquisitions that may result in cash being channelled to the major shareholder in exchange for low-yielding assets. That is, unless the listed firm has a good track record in making use of its cash reserves to make acquisitions or expand its businesses to achieve even better returns. Thus far, Perak Corp has not elaborated on its plan to further grow its businesses with proceeds from the Integrax stake sale. At present, the group derives its earnings from port operations and property development. Port operations contributed RM38.42 million to the group\u2019s total pre-tax profit of RM70.86 million in FY2014, while property development contributed RM34.15 million, a sharp increase from RM9.49 million the year before. Analysts say there is limited growth for the group\u2019s port operations. The throughput at its 50%-plus-one-share owned Lumut Maritime Terminal has remained flat at about three million metric tonnes over the past three years due to the small port\u2019s dependence on hinterland cargo. Its 20-year concession agreement with the state for exclusive port operations within a 30km radius will also end in July. Given the limited growth potential of its port assets, Perak Corp crucially needs funds to fast-track its 1,500-acre township development in Bandar Meru Raya, Perak. The proceeds from the proposed Integrax stake sale, it seems, would come in handy, but minorities chafing at Perak Corp\u2019s relatively low shareholders\u2019 returns over the past few years would also be eager for a windfall.

Fitch Ratings has today revised its outlook on Sime Darby Bhd's Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) to negative, from stable, but affirmed the IDRs and the company\u2019s senior unsecured rating at \u2018A\u2019. Fitch said the revision in the outlook to negative followed a sharp increase in Sime Darby (fundamental: 1.0; valuation: 0.9)'s fund from operation (FFO)-adjusted net leverage to about 2.5 times in the first half of its financial year ending June 30, 2015 (FY15), compared to FY14\u2019s 1.52 times. It said it was well above the 1.75 times level, at which Fitch would consider negative rating action. While Fitch expected the increase in leverage after the debt-funded acquisition of New Britain Palm Oil Ltd (NBPOL), the agency now estimated the deleveraging process would take longer than initially expected. Fitch also affirmed the rating on the company's US$1.5 billion sukuk issue at 'A'. Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd saw its net profit jump 25.7% to RM139.97 million in the fourth financial quarter ended Jan 31, 2015 (4QFY15), from RM111.39 million a year ago, driven by higher subscription, lower installation costs and lower marketing and distribution costs. Astro (fundamental: 1.1; valuation: 2.1) also declared a fourth interim dividend of 2.25 sen per share and a final dividend of 2 sen per share, bringing the full year dividend to 11 sen per share \u2014 a 22% increase over financial year ended Jan 31, 2014 (FY14) payout of 9 sen. Astro said its revenue for 4QFY15 rose 7% to RM1.35 billion, from RM1.26 billion in 4QFY14, mainly due to an increase in subscription and other revenue of RM56.2 million and RM40.4 million respectively, offset by a decrease in advertising revenue of RM8.5 million. For the whole of FY15, net profit rose 15.9% to RM519.37 million or 9.99 sen per share, compared with RM447.95 million or 8.62 sen per share in FY14; while revenue grew 9.2% to RM5.23 billion, from RM4.79 billion.

According to the firm, the IDRs and the company's senior unsecured rating are affirmed at 'A'. Fitch has also affirmed the rating on the company's US$1.50 billion sukuk issue at 'A'. In a statement today, Fitch said the revision in the outlook to negative followed a sharp increase in Sime Darby (fundamental: 1.0; valuation: 0.9)'s fund from operation (FFO)-adjusted net leverage to about 2.50 times in the first half of its financial year ending June 30, 2015 (FY15) compared to FY14\u2019s 1.52 times. It said it was well above the 1.75 times level at which Fitch would consider negative rating action. While Fitch expected the increase in leverage after the debt-funded acquisition of New Britain Palm Oil Ltd (NBPOL), the agency now estimated that the deleveraging process would take longer than initially expected. This is due to the weaker than expected performance of Sime Darby's industrial equipment business and higher net debt to fund the property development business. \"Given the weak commodity environment, Sime Darby's industrial equipment business will continue to face challenges over the short to medium term,\" Fitch said. Fitch said Sime Darby\u2019s industrial division\u2019s earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) declined by 46% to RM316.2 million in the first half (1HFY15) due to the continuing weakness in the Australian mining sector. This has resulted in lower equipment deliveries and lower margin from product support sales, it said. \"Profit in its Malaysia and Singapore operations also fell due to lower equipment and engine sales due to the slowdown in the construction, mining and shipyard sectors, while in China and Hong Kong, profit improved due to better margins from equipment deliveries,\" Fitch added. Commodity prices continued to fall to near marginal production cost, resulting in intense pressure on the product support business, it pointed out. Fitch said Sime Darby proposed to engage in capital management initiatives that could include the listing of its motor division by end financial year 2016 (FY16), which, if successful, would result in financial leverage declining towards Fitch's negative trigger of 1.75 times. \"Also, a significant proportion of Sime Darby's shareholders have opted for its dividend reinvestment plan (DRP), which reduced cash dividends paid by 23% to RM1.57 billion in FY14. \"Of the RM1.80 billion final dividend declared for FY14, only RM505 million (28% of dividends declared) was paid in cash,\" it noted. While Fitch expects Sime Darby to maintain its dividend payout ratio at about 50%, the cash payout is likely to decline due to the success of the DRP, which would help to reduce leverage. Apart from that, Fitch pointed out that Sime Darby debt-funded the acquisition of a 98.84% stake in the Papua New Guinea-based oil palm company NBPOL for RM5.70 billion. NBPOL has a land bank of 135,000 ha, 12 oil mills and two refineries \u2014 one in Papua New Guinea and the other in Liverpool, UK. \"This acquisition has resulted in an increase in Sime Darby's land bank by 16% and improved Sime Darby's capabilities to deliver oil palm products to Europe,\" it said. Fitch also said robust crude palm oil (CPO) output in Malaysia and Indonesia driven by improved productivity, a bumper soybean crop that has narrowed the differential between soybean oil and CPO prices, and a low crude oil price (to which CPO is closely correlated as CPO is a bio-diesel input) has resulted in sustained low CPO prices. \"As Sime Darby is an integrated low-cost CPO operator, its downstream division benefits from declining input costs. But this is not adequate to offset the price decline,\" it said. Fitch believed that the company will tide over this period of low prices, but margins \u2014 in US dollar and per metric ton terms \u2014 would remain depressed in the next 12 to 18 months. However, it said Sime Darby's failure to successfully complete capital management initiatives to reduce its financial leverage to below 1.75 times by end-FY16, a downgrade in Malaysia's Country Ceiling of 'A' and an increase in the role of the Malaysian sovereign or related entities in Sime Darby's decision making process might lead to negative rating action.

The Edge Malaysia business and investment weekly (Edge Weekly) in its latest March 30 - April 5 issue, quoted Mohd Bakke as saying the \u00a37.15 (RM39.05)-a-share price for the entire stake in Papua New Guinea (PNG)-based NBPOL was acceptable. This was due to suitable landbank scarcity besides the high costs and risks of greenfield development. \"We believe we have paid a fair market price. The price expectation of a successful acquisition following the failed Kulim ((M) Bhd) bid was between \u00a36.50 and \u00a37 per share. We paid \u00a37.15 per share, which was at a slight premium to that price.\u00a0 \"In return for the premium, we are getting quality brownfield assets, that is ~135,000ha of landbank with ~81,500ha planted that are fully RSPO certified. Besides oil palm, NBPOL is also involved in beef, sugar and seed production. Furthermore, Sime Darby sees this acquisition as the gateway to future expansion within and outside PNG,\" he said. Mohd Bakke was speaking to Edge Weekly in Port Moresby, PNG where he attended an event to mark the completion of Sime Darby's acquisition of NBPOL on March 2 this year.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\nAccording to him, NBPOL\u2019s upstream business is clearly visible to the market. Mohd Bakke, however, said Sime Darby (fundamental: 1; valuation: 0.9) viewed NBPOL's downstream operations as the \"hidden jewel\". He said this was because NBPOL had succeeded in commanding a price premium for its sustainable palm products. \"I think not every plantation player will be able to appreciate NBPOL\u2019s strengths. Sime Darby and NBPOL\u2019s strengths in the production of sustainable palm oil represent not only our shared business practices and beliefs but also a platform to do greater things together across the value chain,\" he said. Besides plantations, Mohd Bakke also shared his views on Sime Darby's plans for its other businesses. These include property development, automotive dealership, and utilities.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nFor a better understanding on Sime Darby under Mohd Bakke's stewardship, kindly pick up and read the latest issue of the Edge Weekly.

State-owned Perbadanan Kemajuan Negeri Perak is the single largest shareholder of Perak Corp with an effective equity interest of 52.9%, while Sime Darby Property Bhd has a 6.12% stake in Perak Corp. Earlier, at a press conference, Amin, who is co-founder and deputy chairman of Integrax (fundamental: 1.65; valuation: 1.2) and a Perak Corp shareholder, expressed his disappointment with the result of the EGM. \"At the meeting, minority shareholders had raised various proposals including the option to wait and seek for higher offers and that it should be sold at RM3.66 per share,\" he said. \"Not withstanding all that, Perak Corp had decided not to grant a decision to push all that through. \"So, it appears that there is an abandonment,\" Amin said, adding that he was planning to make a voluntary general offer. To recap, Amin has been recommending Integrax's shareholders to reject TNB's (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.8) offer from the onset, saying it \u201cdid not reflect the true value of Integrax, which is at least RM5 per share\u201d. This was even after TNB revised its takeover offer for Integrax by 50 sen from RM2.75 apiece to RM3.25. Amin subsequently offered to buy a 5% stake in Integrax for RM3.50.

Both have joint stakes in Chinese real estate assets, as well as hotels in Hong Kong and China.\u00a0 A number of listed entities on Bursa, such as YTL Corp Bhd, Genting Bhd and Berjaya Corp Bhd, are investment holding companies without a core business of their own. Instead, the businesses are held by their subsidiaries, grouped either by type of business or geography. Usually, investment holding companies do not reflect the sum-of-parts value of their holdings in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associate companies, says Areca Capital Sdn Bhd chief executive Danny Wong. \u201cIn most cases, when there is a holding company, it is usually traded at a discount,\u201d he says, adding that this is because the holding company is rarely a takeover target. \u00a0 Furthermore, in valuing the holding company, it takes into account the values of the individual businesses, and not all the businesses will do well. So, those that are not doing well will drag down the value of the group, he adds. \u00a0 \u201cHolding companies are usually at a discount because of investors\u2019 perception of them \u2014 rojak. But such companies have their advantages \u2026 they are big caps \u2014 meaning more liquidity, better earnings stability and lower risk [because of the various businesses]. By right, they deserve a premium,\u201d says Phillip Capital Management Sdn Bhd chief investment officer Ang Kok Heng. Some investors argue that the structure whereby a holding company holds shares in multiple subsidiaries through a two-tier, or more, shareholding level is not efficient, as the value of the assets at the bottom is not likely to be fully appreciated by the market. However, some corporate advisers note that this conglomerate structure, whereby a holding company holds shares in several other listed and privately held firms, exists because the major shareholders want to maintain control of the group\u2019s vast businesses. Such a structure is more prevalent in family-owned businesses, as the holding company will be where the founding family oversees and exercises management control over subsidiaries and associate companies. \u201cWhat YTL did was in a manner for the family structure; it is not so much about realising trapped values. It is for them to hold all the family members together, by holding the investments at YTL Corp. Then, they control from there,\u201d says Muh Rong. \u201cWhether a holding company structure is efficient or not, it depends on what the owner thinks and wants. If the owner wants to maintain control in the sense of \u2018wrapping\u2019 the entire group, it will be through an investment holding company. \u201cBut, for investors, is it the best to have a structure like that? Not necessarily. For investors, no one is stopping them from investing directly. If they don\u2019t like the holding company, they can always invest in the subsidiaries.\u201d Despite the fact that YTL Corp (fundamental: 1.2; valuation: 1.2) trades at a lower price-to-earnings multiple compared with some of its Bursa-listed subsidiaries, the Yeoh family is seen as being comfortable with the group\u2019s structure as the profits from these companies still flow back to the top. YTL Group comprises Bursa-listed YTL Power International Bhd, YTL Land & Development Bhd, YTL e-Solutions Bhd and YTL Hospitality Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) and Singapore-listed StarHill Global REIT. YTL Power (fundamental: 1.2; valuation: 2.4) operates power plants and treats waste water, besides owning YTL Communications Sdn Bhd, which is the 4G mobile telecommunications operator. YTL Land (fundamental: 0.7; valuation: 0.9) is a property development company and YTL REIT (fundamental: 0.15; valuation: 3) manages the group\u2019s hospitality properties. As at Feb 16, YTL Corp was traded at 14 times its historical earnings per share, while YTL Land and YTL e-Solutions were valued at 30.6 times and 20.8 times respectively. In a report dated Feb 13, CIMB Research ascribed a 20% discount to YTL Corp\u2019s revalued net asset value (RNAV) of RM2.92 per share, giving it a fair value of RM2.34. While investors can always choose to bet on either YTL Corp or any of its listed subsidiaries, for instance, they have no choice when it comes to investing in Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (MRCB). This is because the group is the only listed entity, holding all the property development assets and construction and concession businesses. In a report dated Dec 16, 2014, RHB Research Institute values the RNAV of MRCB (fundamental: 0.45; valuation: 0.6) at RM2 per share. The group was trading at RM1.42 last Tuesday, a discount of almost 30% to its RNAV. The emergence of conglomerates The conglomerate corporate structure came in vogue in the 1990s in Asia. The decade saw the emergence of big conglomerates in major Asian economies, ranging from state-owned enterprises to family-owned groups. Also, as a corporation grows, it usually embarks on an expansion drive through mergers and acquisitions. Often these corporations end up having multiple businesses, which could be grouped under a separate stand-alone entity. \u00a0 The growth will come to a point where the corporation has become too big with multiple core businesses.\u00a0Shareholders would soon realise that investors are not rewarding the group for the high-growth areas that they have invested in. \u201cWhen a conglomerate comes to a situation like that, they will start to think of ways to unlock the values of their businesses. There are two ways to do that: by injecting assets into another public-listed company to get shares in that company, and by asset disposals,\u201d says Muh Rong. The 1998 Asian financial crisis proved to be the undoing of some of the conglomerates that grew too fast. The rapid expansion of these corporations involved debt accumulation, which proved to be unsustainable. The rapid depreciation of the baht, won, ringgit and rupiah led to prominent conglomerates being broken up as they struggled under the weight of mounting foreign currency debt. In Malaysia, the restructuring of the Renong-UEM Group and the listing of MRCB\u2019s media businesses are some of the examples of conglomerates being restructured to pare down debts. The disposal of Multi-Purpose Holdings Bhd\u2019s (MPHB) associate stake in Sarawak Enterprise (now Sarawak Energy Bhd) was to unlock value. Conglomerates seem to be less favoured by investors today compared with the 1990s. One of the after-effects of the Asian financial crisis is that investors are quite averse to conglomerate structures and are keener to invest in groups with two or three focused businesses. This is because while it is easier for conglomerates to raise funds, their sheer size and multiple core businesses make them very difficult for the top management to focus sometimes, says Danny. \u201cI am among those who like stand-alone businesses more than conglomerates. First, the structure is better because each of the businesses will have a better view of debt-to-equity ratio. There could also be a different dividend policy,\u201d he says. Companies with capital-intensive businesses may pay lower dividends compared with those with more mature businesses, as they will have to reserve cash for reinvestments. \u201cInvesting in stand-alone businesses allows the investor to choose the kind of dividend payout ratio that he is comfortable with. If I am investing in a conglomerate, the dividend policy would have to consider the capital requirements of all its businesses,\u201d Danny explains. In recent years, some major shareholders of listed corporations in Malaysia have undertaken restructuring to unlock value within the group. In the past, there had been several such restructurings, thus benefiting shareholders. The more prominent ones include the relisting of IOI Properties Group Bhd by IOI Corp Bhd, the demerger of MPHB into Magnum Bhd and MPHB Capital Bhd, and the demerger of Telekom Malaysia Bhd (see \u201cCorporate exercises \u2014 boon or bane for investors?\u201d). The demerger of the gaming and financial service businesses of MPHB also unlocked the values of the property assets owned by both groups, which was almost similar to the case of the restructuring of the Cheung Kong-Hutchison Whampoa group. IOI Corp\u2019s (fundamental: 1.7; valuation: 2.1) listing of its property development business has also unlocked values and separates the growth needs of that arm from those of the plantation business. Berjaya Corp (fundamental: 0.35; valuation: 1.2) has over the last few years undertaken a few rounds of successful listing of its food, retail and motor businesses, making the major shareholder many times richer. For instance, the listing of Berjaya Auto Bhd has increased the value of Berjaya Corp\u2019s 67.6% stake in the business by at least four times. Conglomerate Sime Darby Bhd is now working on the listing of its automotive arm this year to unlock value for its shareholders. Sime Darby Motors distributes BMW cars in Hong Kong, China, Vietnam and Australia. This could be followed by the listing of its Indonesian plantation assets. It is worth noting that Sime Darby (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.3) is the result of the Synergy Drive mega merger of nine plantation and property companies owned by Permodalan Nasional Bhd. The enlarged Sime Darby was relisted on Bursa in 2007. \u00a0 The merger was initially seen as beneficial to shareholders of the companies involved, including the original Sime Darby, Golden Hope Plantations Bhd and Guthrie Bhd, as a bigger conglomerate would be able to expand its businesses more rapidly. However, Sime Darby\u2019s shares have been trading at less than RM10 over the last six years. From the relisting on Nov 27, 2007, to last Tuesday, the share price of Sime Darby has depreciated 12.9%, supporting the argument that the mega merger has failed to create value for its shareholders. Nevertheless, an investor who had bought Sime Darby shares in early 2007, before the mega merger, would still be better off \u2014 making a capital gain of at least 50% on the original investment \u2014 if he had held on to his shares up to last Tuesday. Corporate advisers believe that the owners and top management of conglomerates know what they want and have strategies to achieve their internal objectives. Restructuring should be done for the right reasons. \u201cI am sure there are always values to be unlocked in a conglomerate, but it all boils down to the strategy of the management. We can make a lot of assumptions, but the management knows better what it wants to do. \u201cFor example, if Sime Darby were to list any of its businesses, it should be done so that it is easier for the individual businesses to raise funds for future expansion,\u201d says Kenny Yee, head of research of BIMB Securities. Although conglomerates are less favoured these days, Muh Rong believes that there could come a time when the diversified group structure is back as the darling of investors. This is when groups can prove to investors that they can undertake big projects more efficiently than smaller stand-alone companies, she says. \u201cWhen the market realises that diversified groups can do big deals in an efficient manner, then the market will start paying premium on the stocks. They need to be big but do smart deals, deals that bring value to their shareholders. If they can do that, investors will trust their judgements,\u201d she adds. \u00a0 Note: The Edge Research\u2019s fundamental score reflects a company\u2019s profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers.

Sime Darby Bhd (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.3)'s wholly-owned unit, Sime Darby Plantation Sdn Bhd (Sime Darby Plantation), has completed the acquisition of UK and Papua New Guinea-listed New Britain Palm Oil Ltd (NBPOL). The NBPOL buy will add another 135,000 ha of land in Papua New Guinea to Sime Darby Plantation\u2019s land bank and bring it to about 1 million ha, spread out in five countries. Following the completion of the acquisition, five representatives from Sime Darby Plantation will be appointed to the board of NBPOL, namely Datuk Henry Sackville Barlow, Datuk Rashidi Che Omar, Rosely Kusip, Tan Sri Mohd Bakke Salleh and Datuk Franki Anthony Dass, with Barlow set to be appointed chairman of the board. To recap, on Oct 9 last year, Sime Darby launched a conditional general offer (GO) to acquire all shares in NBPOL at \u00a37.15 per share or \u00a31.07 billion cash. The offer turned unconditional in February this year. Oil and gas company Perisai Petroleum Teknologi Bhd (fundamental: 0.35; valuation: 1.2) has secured a further extension \u2014 worth US$3.65 million (RM13.24 million) \u2014 for its marine vessel charters. Perisai\u2019s major shareholder, Emas Offshore Pte Ltd, opted to lease Perisai's three vessels for another two years, from August 31, 2015 to August 31, 2017. The extensions will have no effect on the issued and paid-up capital of the company and is expected to contribute positively to Perisai group\u2019s earnings and net tangible assets for the financial year ending December 31 2015 and the financial periods thereafter, in the duration of the extension charters. The two-year extension followed a three-year extension between September 1, 2012 and August 31, 2015, for the vessels known as Sarah Gold, Sarah Jade and Bayu Pearl. Pesona Metro Holdings Bhd (fundamental: 1.7; valuation: 0.3)\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary Pesona Metro Sdn Bhd has secured a joint-venture project worth RM172.72 million with Pembinaan Kaleigh Sdn Bhd and Hanawin Sdn Bhd, for road works in Pahang. The contract entails road works for Section 3E2 (Merapoh to Kg Kubang Rusa), which is a part of the Central Spine Road Package 3, linking Gua Musang, Kelantan to Kg Relong, Pahang. Pesona Metro had previously completed the road works for Section 3F of the highway in 2013. The works are expected to take 36 months from the date of procession of the site on March 17, 2015. YFG Bhd (fundamental: 0.15; valuation: 0.6)\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, YFG Properties Sdn Bhd (YFGP), has proposed to dispose of a piece of freehold land in Bukit Jelutong, together with a three-storey office building and an annexed single storey warehouse, to Rangkaian Handal Sdn Bhd for RM17.6 million. YFG expects to book a net gain of RM1.88 million from the disposal, which translates into a consolidated earnings per share (EPS) of 31 sen for the financial year ending June 30, 2015. The property was acquired by YFGP on Aug 16, 2012, at a cost of RM13.2 million. YFGP had since incurred additional costs of about RM1.52 million for renovation, legal fees and stamp duty. Of the total proceeds, YFG has allocated RM13.5 million to repay borrowings, RM3.095 million for working capital and RM1.005 million to cover expenses incurred for the disposal. Pursuant to the disposal, YFG will be relocating its operations to another premise, yet to be determined.

Plenitude Bhd (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 1.8) has proposed a conditional take-over of The Nomad Group Bhd (fundamental: 1.05; valuation: 1.2) at an offer price of RM1.25 per share. The takeover will be satisfied by the issuance of new Plenitude shares at an issue price of RM2.50 each, with each holder of the offer share who accepts the offer to receive one consideration share (Plenitude shares) for every two offer shares (The Nomad Group shares) surrendered. The acquisition will see the issuance of up to 111.53 million new Plenitude shares for RM278.83 million. The new shares issued translates to 29.23% of the enlarged share capital. The deal would increase Plenitude's issued and paid-up share capital to 381.53 million, from 270 million. The proposed offer represents an opportunity for the company to expand its hotel segment to diversify its earnings base and enhance its source of recurring income. Following the acquisition, Plenitude will take The Nomad Group private.

We maintain \u201cneutral\u201d, with a TP of RM8.50 (9.3% downside). As we believe this could be the first year Sime does not meet its key performance indicators profit target of RM2.5 billion, we reduce our forecasts to reflect this. Nevertheless, news flow surrounding its demerger or restructuring plans could still provide support to its share price.\u00a0 Sime\u2019s 6MFY15 core earnings were below expectations at 34% and 31% of our and consensus FY15 forecasts (F). The main variances were lower-than-expected fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production growth of -6.4% in 6MFY15 (versus our projected +3.7% for FY15), a lower price of crude palm oil achieved at RM2,154 per tonne in 6MFY15 (versus our RM2,450 per tonne projection), weaker-than-expected earnings at the heavy equipment and motor units, and some marketing expenses incurred for its Battersea property project. It booked a net exceptional gain of RM3 million in the second quarter of FY15 (2QFY15), comprising a gain of RM21 million from a sale of a wave breaker in Weifang, China to a joint venture company, and a restructuring expense of RM18 million for its downstream operations. Sime declared an interim net dividend per share \u00a0of six sen.\u00a0 Key briefing takeaways: It is cutting its FFB production growth target to 0 from 5% for FY15, the management is rejigging targets for the heavy equipment unit, given the bleak profit contribution, the property unit is still holding up well in 6MFY15, and an update on the acquisition of New Britain Palm Oil Ltd (NBPOL) was given.\u00a0 Lower earnings are expected, moving forward. We cut our earnings for FY15F by 10.3% and for FY16F to FY17F by 2% to 3%, after imputing weaker contributions from the heavy equipment and motor unit, as well as trimming our FFB production target for FY15 to -2% (from +3.7%), while maintaining our 3% to 4% growth rate for FY16F to FY17F. We highlight that we will only impute its proposed NBPOL acquisition once completed, which is likely to be by March. This proposed acquisition would be earnings-accretive for Sime, potentially adding 3% to 4% per annum to its net earnings.\u00a0 We adjust down our sum-of-parts-based TP to RM8.50 (RM8.75) but keep our \u201cneutral\u201d recommendation on the stock. Although its earnings prospects remain rather subdued, we believe news flow surrounding Sime\u2019s potential restructuring or demerger proposals could provide some support to the company\u2019s share price. \u2014 RHB Research, Feb 27  \u00a0 This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on March 2, 2015."}, "239": {"date_posted": "2/3/2015", "title": "Is RM3.25 a fair price for Integrax?", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: Last Wednesday, Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) revealed how serious it was about acquiring Integrax Bhd. The utility company raised its offer price for the port operator to RM3.25 per share, up 50 sen from its initial bid of RM2.75. The revised offer came on the heels of Perak Corp Bhd\u2019s (fundamental: 1.9; valuation: 1.2) remark that it would part with its 15.74% equity interest in Integrax (fundamental: 1.65; valuation: 0.6) for RM3.25 apiece. However, given the strategic value of Lumut Port \u2014 Integrax\u2019s core asset \u2014 the company\u2019s other shareholders may not still consider the higher offer price fair because TNB (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.8) relies solely on the port for the import of coal. In fact, sources familiar with the matter said Amin Halim Rasip, Integrax\u2019s largest shareholder with a 23.09% stake, is unlikely to accept the offer. If that is the case, TNB may have difficulties in gaining a controlling stake in Integrax, let alone take the port operator private. Amin, who is deputy chairman of Integrax, has vehemently opposed TNB\u2019s takeover attempt and rejected its RM2.75 per share offer shortly after it was made. In a circular, Integrax noted Amin\u2019s aspirations to grow the company and its port assets, which comprise the Lekir Bulk Terminal (LBT) and the Lumut Maritime Terminal (LMT). TNB\u2019s rationale for the privatisation plan is simple. It wants full control of Integrax so that it can secure the handling of coal supply to its power plant in Janamanjung, Perak, which is expected to generate close to a fifth of Peninsular Malaysia\u2019s electricity supply by 2017. LBT in Lumut currently handles more than seven million tonnes of coal a year. With TNB\u2019s Manjung 4 coal-fired power plant expected to commence operations this month, another three million tonnes per year will be added to LBT\u2019s coal throughput. Interestingly, TNB\u2019s revised offer was announced at the same time as a new 25-year coal-handling contract for the 1,000mw Manjung 5 power plant, which begins operations in 2017. RHB Research is in favour of the new offer. \u201cThe revised offer is 32% above our RM2.46 per share valuation of Integrax, premised solely on the earnings outlook of TNB\u2019s five power plants in Manjung and the dividend stream from LMT. The offer also implies a forward earnings multiple of 29 times, which we think is generous,\u201d said its analyst Ahmad Maghfur Usman. Integrax\u2019s minority shareholders may be strongly tempted to sell at RM3.25 as they stand to gain at least 85 sen per share had they bought the stock last year, when it fluctuated between RM1.90 and RM2.40. The company reported a FY2014 net profit of RM38.69 million, down 5.42% from RM40.91 million in FY2013. Its current net asset value per share stands at RM2.13, substantially below TNB\u2019s offer. Some said given LBT\u2019s crucial position in the handling and delivery of fuel to TNB\u2019s power plants, its earnings potential and asset appreciation should fetch a much higher valuation than RM3.25. M&A Securities Sdn Bhd, which is the independent adviser for the deal, has pegged a net asset value per share of RM3.62 to Integrax in a Feb 16 report. Perak Corp\u2019s valuation of Integrax came from its own adviser, Affin Hwang Investment Bank Bhd. The group is expected to hold an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) by the end of this month to seek the approval of its shareholders to sell its Integrax stake. Perak Corp will pocket some RM150 million cash if it accepts the revised offer, giving it a net divestment gain of RM52.31 million. In a statement, the Minority Shareholders Watchdog Group advised Integrax\u2019s shareholders to take into account the different valuations in order to make an informed decision. \u201cMinorities have to decide whether to sell based on their respective risk-reward profiles and investment horizons while also taking into account how they view the prospects for the company.\u201d For now, it looks like TNB\u2019s priority is to secure Perak Corp\u2019s stake, which would lift its shareholding to 38.86%. For the takeover offer to be unconditional, TNB will need to obtain at least 13% of the remaining share base held by Integrax\u2019s minority shareholders and gain at least 51% control of the port operator. However, it is too early to conclude that Perak Corp will definitely sell its stake as its board has yet to obtain the approval of its shareholders. It is worth noting that its substantial shareholder, Sime Darby Properties Sdn Bhd, blocked its privatisation just a few months ago, saying the offer from the Perak State Development Corp was not attractive enough. So, will Sime Darby play hardball again? This could be interesting to watch. Excluding the stakes owned by TNB, Perak Corp and Amin, Integrax\u2019s share base amounts to some 114 million. A look at the company\u2019s top shareholders shows a smattering of fund managers with stakes ranging from 1% to 4%, which could ultimately decide the outcome of TNB\u2019s takeover attempt. The closing date for the revised offer is March 31. It is likely that by then, Perak Corp would have held its EGM and made known its acceptance.

Revenue, however, rose slightly to RM10.74 billion, from RM10.71 billion. For the six-month period (1HFY15), Sime Darby\u2019s net profit dropped 28.2% to RM938.09 million from RM1.31 billion a year ago, while revenue fell 2% to RM20.87 billion from RM21.29 billion in 1HFY14. Despite weaker results, Sime Darby proposed an interim dividend of six sen for FY15 ending June 30, payable on May 8. Bakke said 1HFY15 was challenging, as the sharp decline in crude oil prices and deceleration of global economic growth had resulted in the need for greater productivity and cost efficiency. \u201cThe group\u2019s portfolio of diversified businesses and stringent capital allocation will be crucial in carrying us through this volatility, and the focus is to strive to meet the targets under the key performance indicators (KPIs) that we set. \u201cWe believe long-term market fundamentals remain attractive, despite the easing of commodity prices,\u201d he said. He sees crude palm oil trading at between RM2,300 and 2,500 per tonne in 2HFY15. Sime Darby group chief financial officer Datuk Tong Poh Keow said the debt-equity ratio at 39.9% as at Dec 31, 2014 is expected to increase after the payment is done for the acquisition of New Britain Palm Oil Ltd (NBPOL). The RM5.6 billion acquisition of\u00a0NBPOL will be funded by debt (80%) and internal funds (20%). She said the comfortable level of the group\u2019s debt-equity ratio is from 35% to 45%, adding that the listing of its motor division and Indonesian plantation business would help to manage the group\u2019s gearing level. Tong also said about RM3.5 billion to RM4 billion have been allocated as capital expenditure for FY15, up from RM3 billion in FY14. On news that Tan Sri Liew Kee Sin has tendered his resignation as the chairman of\u00a0Battersea Project Holding Company Ltd (BPHC), Bakke said there was \u201cnothing official\u201d on this, denying that the board of BPHC has received Liew\u2019s resignation letter. Liew was quoted in a local news report as saying that he had tendered his resignation to BPHC, and was \u201cwaiting for a response\u201d from the latter\u2019s board. Sime Darby holds a 40% stake in BPHC \u2014 the consortium that is undertaking the \u00a38 billion\u00a0(RM44.37 billion) Battersea Power Station\u00a0redevelopment project in London.

DRB-Hicom Bhd, the parent company of national carmaker Proton Holdings Bhd, saw its net profit plunged 94% to RM9.47 million or 0.49 sen a share for the third quarter ended Dec 31, 2014, from RM147.66 million or 7.64 sen a share a year earlier. However, revenue for the quarter rose 6% to RM3.53 billion, from RM3.33 billion previously. The sharp decline was blamed on higher taxation of RM72.7 million for the quarter, compared to a tax write-back of RM6.1 million in the previous corresponding quarter. The group declared a single-tier dividend of 1.5 sen a share for the quarter, payable on April 28. As for its nine months to Dec 31 (9MFY15), net profit fell 29% to RM210.4 million or 10.88 sen per share, despite revenue having climbed 4% to RM10.48 billion. For the remainder of its financial year, DRB-Hicom said it is \u201cwell-positioned to deliver positive results, albeit lower than the previous financial year\u201d. IJM Corp Bhd (IJM) announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary IJM Construction Sdn Bhd has bagged a RM1.19 billion contract from Kuantan Port Consortium Sdn Bhd, to construct New Deep Water Terminal (NDWT) at Kuantan Port (KPC), Pahang. IJM\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary Road Builder (M) Holdings Bhd has a 62% stake in KPC.\n\u00a0\nKPC has a 30 year concession from the government, to operate Kuantan Port. With the development of the NDWT, IJM said it will sign a new privatisation agreement for 30 years, with an option to extend another thirty 30 years. The group added that it plans to expand the port to cater for ships up to 200,000 deadweight tonnage (DWT), with an expected operation to commence as early as 2016. Wah Seong Corp Bhd (Wah Seong) saw its profit surge by 67.6% for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2014 (4QFY14), to RM34.56 million or 4.48 sen per share. Likewise, quarterly revenue rose 43.9% to RM711.53 million, mainly due to higher number of oil and gas (O&G) projects having been implemented. For the full year, Wah Seong reported net profit had multiplied to RM125.57 million or 16.26 sen per share, from RM32.32 million in FY2013. Likewise, revenue had increased by 37% to RM2.44 billion, due to new projects in its O&G segment, industrial training and services segment, as well as its renewable energy segment. Property developer UEM Sunrise Bhd\u2019s (UEM Sunrise) net profit more than tripled to RM272.38 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2014, from RM77.96 million a year earlier, bringing its basic earnings per share (EPS) to 6 sen, from 1.79 sen. Revenue for the quarter soared 134% to RM1.34 billion, from RM573.11 million in the year before. However, for the full year of 2014, net profit came in 17% lower at RM479.93 million, compared to RM579.14 million in FY13, despite a 10% year-on-year increase in revenue to RM2.66 billion, from RM2.43 billion. The lower profit was attributed to lower margin from land sales, which was partly offset by higher profit from property development. According to UEM Sunrise, it will be launching several new projects, including Estuari, Denai Nusantara and Gerbang Nusantara in the southern region, and Serene Heights, Artisan Hills and Sefina in the central region. It will also be launching Conservatory, its second Australian project, in the second half of 2015. Sime Darby Bhd\u2019s net profit dipped 47% to RM437.4 million in the second quarter ended December 31, 2014 (2QFY15), from RM818.31 million a year earlier. The decrease was due to a dip in its plantation, industrial, automotive and property income. Sime Darby (fundamental: 1.3, valuation: 1.3) said revenue increased to RM10.74 billion, from RM10.71 billion. For the six months (1HFY15), Sime Darby recorded a decrease in net profit to RM938.1 million, from RM1.31 billion a year earlier. Revenue fell to RM20.87 million, from RM21.29 million. Despite a decline in 2QFY15 profit, Sime Darby proposed a dividend of six sen for the quarter under review. Sime Darby president and group chief executive officer Tan Sri Mohd Bakke Salleh told pressmen today, that 1HFY15 was challenging, due to tough market conditions. Mohd Bakke said the sharp decline in crude oil prices and global economic growth deceleration, had resulted in the need for greater productivity and cost efficiency. He also said Sime Darby will defer the listing of its automotive arm to the second half of this year, as the market is \u201cnot conducive\u201d for a listing right now. Lafarge Malaysia Bhd (Lafarge) reported a 30% drop in net profit to RM256 million for financial year ended Dec 31, 2014 (FY14), due to continued price pressures and higher operating costs. Meanwhile, revenue of the country\u2019s largest cement producer had eased 4% year-on-year to RM2.7 billion.\n\u00a0\nIn a press statement, Lafarge said contribution from the concrete segment increased, but revenue from the cement and aggregate divisions declined due to lower cement prices. Meanwhile, operating cost rose due to higher electricity tariff, plant maintenance and higher transport cost. Steel products manufacturer, Lion Corporation Bhd, saw its net loss widen to RM123.31 million or 9.37 sen a share in its second quarter ended Dec 31, 2014 (2QFY15), from RM33.18 million previously, due to sluggish demand in the domestic steel market. Revenue in 2QFY15 also decreased 35.42% to RM474.28 million, from RM734.38 million, its filing with Bursa Malaysia showed. It said sluggish demand in the domestic steel market is due to rampant dumping activities by foreign steel players, which it said remained a major market disturbance. Lion Corp said pending the effectiveness of the Anti-Dumping Duty measures by the government, the operating environment for its steel business is expected to remain challenging in the coming quarter. QL Resources Bhd (QL) saw its net profit for its third quarter ended Dec 31, 2014 (3QFY15) increased by 24.7% to RM55.62 million or 4.46 sen per share, from RM44.61 million or 3.89 sen per share in 3QFY14. This was mainly due to higher contributions from raw material trade and poultry operations from its integrated livestock farming division. Meanwhile, the poultry farmer reported a 10.1% increase in revenue to RM732.82 million in 3QFY15, from RM665.63 million in 3QFY14, mainly due to overall higher contribution from its marine product manufacturing, namely its surimi-based products, fishmeal operations and new shrimp farming. Budget airline AirAsia Bhd slipped into the red in its fourth quarter ended Dec 31 2014 (4QFY14), with a net loss of RM428.51 million or 15.4 sen per share, compared to a net profit of RM168.5 million or 6.1 sen per share a year ago, due to foreign exchange (forex) losses and lower net operating profit. AirAsia (fundamental score: 1.3; valuation score: 1.8) said its net operating profit for 4QFY14 fell 9% to RM109.8 million, due to higher finance costs relating to bank borrowings, as the airline took delivery of new aircraft, as well as to finance its new AirAsia headquarters at klia2 in Sepang. Revenue however, climbed 15.8% to RM1.48 billion, from RM1.28 billion in 4QFY13, which it said was because of double-digit growth in both average fare and ancillary income per passenger, which increased 13% and 31% year-on-year respectively. The poor quarterly results dragged AirAsia's net profit for the full financial year ended Dec 31, 2014 (FY14) down 77.1% to RM82.84 million, from RM362.12 million the previous year, despite its revenue climbing 5.9% to RM5.42 billion, from RM5.11 billion in FY13. Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) raked in a net profit of RM218.3 million or 5.9 sen per share in its fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2014 (4QFY14), down 36.59% from RM344.24 million or 9.62 sen per share in the previous corresponding period, on the back of higher operating costs and taxation. Its revenue during the quarter under review, however, was up 5.96% on-year to RM3.16 billion, from RM2.98 billion, due to higher contributions from its Internet and multimedia and data services, its filing today with Bursa Malaysia, showed. Telekom proposed a final dividend of 13.4 sen per share, subject to shareholders' approval at its forthcoming annual general meeting. For its full FY14, Telekom's net profit was at RM831.81 million, a decline of 17.82% from RM1.01 billion in FY13 \u2014 also due to higher operating costs and tax charge \u2014 even though revenue came in 5.71% higher at RM11.24 billion, compared to RM10.63 billion previuosly. Similarly, Telekom said the higher revenue was achieved on the back of higher revenue from Internet and multimedia, data and other telecommunication-related services, which was partially offset by lower contribution from voice and non-telecommunication-related services. Malayan Banking Bhd\u2019s net profit in the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2014 (4QFY14), increased 12% to RM1.93 billion, from RM1.73 billion a year earlier, on higher net interest, Islamic banking and insurance income. Revenue came in higher at RM9.66 billion versus RM8.27 billion. Maybank said net interest and Islamic banking income increased 2.3%, as conventional and Islamic financing grew. Net insurance premiums from its conventional and Islamic insurance subsidiaries increased to RM1.02 billion, according to the group. For the full year, Maybank posted a higher net profit of RM6.72 billion, from RM6.55 billion a year earlier. Revenue rose to RM35.71 billion, from RM33.25 billion. Maybank plans to reward shareholders with a dividend of 33 sen a share for 4QFY14, bringing full-year dividends to 57 sen.

Integrax Bhd's second largest shareholder Perak Corp Bhd (fundamental: 1.9; valuation: 1.2) is not selling its 15.74% stake (47.34 million shares) in Integrax to Tenaga Nasional Bhd, if the utility giant does not up its offer of RM2.75 per Integrax (fundamental: 1.65; valuation: 0.6) share to RM3.25 apiece. This latest development could further erode Tenaga\u2019s (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.8) hope to take over the port operator, given Integrax\u2019s co-founder and biggest shareholder Amin Halim Rasip, who holds a 23.15% stake, has already rejected Tenaga\u2019s offer and has consequently bought more shares in Integrax. Perak Corp\u2019s filing with Bursa Malaysia today said its rejection was made after reviewing the independent advice circular by M&A Securities Sdn Bhd \u2014 which viewed Tenaga\u2019s offer as \u201cnot fair\u201d but \u201creasonable\u201d \u2014 and receiving the recommendation of its appointed adviser Affin Hwang Investment Bank Bhd.

The hotel operator\u2019s quarterly revenue fell 5% to RM125.05 million, from RM131.74 million in the year before, its filing to Bursa Malaysia showed today. The weaker financials notwithstanding, the group has declared a final single-tier dividend of 9 sen per share for the period ended Dec 31, down from the 15 sen in the previous year, payable on June 30, 2015.

MFM (fundamental: 1.1; valuation: 1.8) also reported a 9.28% drop in revenue to RM574.14 million in 4QFY14, from RM632.89 million in 4QFY13, due to lower sales in the poultry integration segment.

Now, the question is, will Tenaga raise its offer price to gain full control of Lumut Port, which takes care of the coal requirements of Tenaga\u2019s power plants nearby. The offer of RM2.75 is already at a premium of 21.7% to the closing price of Integrax (fundamental: 1.65; valuation: 0.60) prior to the takeover announcement. At that price, the takeover offer would cost Tenaga RM644.23 million, which RAM Ratings describes as \u201cnegligible in relation to the utility group\u2019s key financial metrics\u201d. At press time, Tenaga (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.0) did not immediately respond to request for comment by The Edge. Amin, the single largest shareholder of Integrax with 22.81% deemed equity interest (see chart), has now single-handedly blocked the privatisation deal. Without his supporting votes, Tenaga, which holds a 22.12% stake, would not be able to garner 90% acceptance from the shareholders with non-interested shareholding \u2014 equivalent to 77.88% or 234.27 million shares. Last Friday, Amin, who is also the deputy chairman of Integrax, said he will not part with his shares at RM2.75 each as the offer price is not fair and not reasonable, noting that Tenaga\u2019s offer does not reflect the value of Integrax. \u201cThere is more value to be gained and I recommend that shareholders reject the Tenaga offer [of RM2.75 per share] and, depending on shareholders\u2019 needs in the near term, hold out for a much higher price and derive significant value and more shareholder benefits for the long term,\u201d he said. In the statement, Amin said his remarks were made solely based on his capacity as a shareholder and did not represent the views of Integrax\u2019s board of directors and management. Following the opposition, it remains to be seen if Tenaga will withdraw its takeover offer as, even if all the remaining shareholders accept the offer, it would not be able to meet its main objective of taking Integrax private. So far, the company\u2019s third largest shareholder Perak Corp Bhd, which is controlled by Perbadanan Kemajuan Negeri Perak (PKNP), has yet to reveal its stance on the takeover offer. Perak Corp (fundamental: 1.9; valuation: 1.2) holds a 15.74% stake in Integrax.\u00a0 The state-controlled entity could not be reached for comments. Interestingly, PKNP \u2014 the state government body under the purview of the menteri besar of Perak \u2014 had just in October last year withdrawn its selective capital reduction (SCR) offer to take Perak Corp private at RM3.90 per share. The withdrawal was made after Sime Darby Property Bhd informed the company that it intended to vote against the proposed SCR at the extraordinary general meeting. An analyst who tracks Integrax says he expects some resistances from PKNP and Perak Corp. \u201cThey (PKNP) want Lumut Port to play a bigger role in future. Their objective is not just making money but also to uplift the social economic growth in Perak.\u201d The hefty premium price that Tenaga is willing to pay seems like an irresistible offer for many minority shareholders, considering that Integrax\u2019s shares have not been traded at the RM2.75 level in the past 10 years. However, it is still an offer that Amin and Perak Corp can afford to resist. The former is eyeing a deal from Vale International SA and is taking Integrax\u2019s future earnings into consideration. The latter, meanwhile, relies on the port business to provide a stable and consistent income. The cash offer from Tenaga values the Lumut port owner at a price-to-book value of 1.3 times, as well as a historical price-earnings ratio of 20.2 times, based on Integrax\u2019s net asset value per share of RM2.09 as at Sept 30, 2014, and its earnings per share of 13.6 sen in the financial year ended Dec 31, 2013. Integrax is a zero gearing and cash rich company. Its net cash position stood at RM154.6 million as at Sept 30, 2014, with total assets worth RM749.3 million. However, RHB Research and Kenanga Research have advised the minority shareholders of Integrax to accept the offer. The deal-breaker could be Integrax\u2019s possible tie-up with Brazilian mining player and logistics operator Vale. It is understood that Tenaga has always wanted Integrax to focus on the utility group\u2019s coal requirements for its power plants while the likes of Amin and Perak Corp want Integrax to serve Vale and other clients. In 1999, Lekir Bulk Terminal (LBT) executed a jetty terminal usage agreement (JTUA) with TNB Janamanjung Sdn Bhd for the provision of coal unloading and delivery services to the power station. JTUA 2 was signed in 2012 to provide a new additional grab ship unloader for the handling of coal for the Manjung 4 power plant, which is scheduled to begin operations in the first quarter of 2015. Currently, Tenaga is in talks with Integrax on JTUA 3 for the new Manjung 5 power plant. Analysts anticipate that the agreement could be secured in 2016, but the earliest contribution from this project is expected to come only in 2018. Hong Leong Investment Bank Research analyst Daniel Wong tells The Edge that there has always been some disagreement between Tenaga and Integrax\u2019s board on the future planning of the port utilisation at Lumut Port. \u201cIf big players such as Vale come into the picture, Integrax will have to give a high allocation to them (the new customers),\u201d he says. To recap, Integrax first signed a transhipment agreement with Vale in 2009, but it was subsequently scrapped in 2010 when Amin and his brother, Harun Halim Rasip, could not agree on how Vale\u2019s iron ore requirements should be handled. Eventually, Harun resigned as CEO of Integrax and sold his 22% stake in the company to Tenaga at RM1.60 apiece. In his statement, Amin highlighted that Integrax\u2019s port assets, namely LBT and Lumut Maritime Terminal (LMT), have high enterprise and strategic values, as well as proven track records as catalysts in the growth of Perak\u2019s resource and industrial base. \u201cAs a business, we are insulated and not sensitive to commodity price movements as commodities like coal [are still needed] irrespective of commodity prices,\u201d Amin said. LMT is jointly-controlled by Integrax and Perak Corp, while LBT is 80% owned by Integrax.

This is because the property tycoon is involved in a personal endeavour in London \u2014 the development of property projects worth \u00a32.2 billion (RM11.8 billion) \u2014 which may give rise to conflicts of interest. The projects also pave the way for the listing of Liew\u2019s special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Eco World International Bhd (EWI) back home. Last week, Eco World Investment Co Ltd (EW Investment), a private vehicle controlled by Liew and his long-time partner Datuk Voon Tin Yow, announced three large-scale residential projects in Central London with a combined gross development value of \u00a32.2 billion. EW Investment was incorporated in Jersey, Channel Islands, in November last year with Liew holding a 70% stake and Voon 30%. The latter was the chief operating officer of S P Setia during Liew\u2019s tenure as its president and CEO. These mega property projects will be undertaken through Eco World Ballymore Holding Co Ltd (EcoWorld-Ballymore), a joint venture between EW Investment and Ireland-based Ballymore Group. EW Investment will own 75% equity interest in EcoWorld-Ballymore. To recap, BPHCL was set up to undertake the redevelopment of the iconic Battersea Power Station by S P Setia (fundamental: 1.4; valuation: 1.2), Sime Darby Properties Sdn Bhd (SD Prop) and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF). S P Setia and SD Prop own a 40% stake each in BPHCL while the EPF owns 20%. \u201cNow that Liew is launching his own projects in London, there are bound to be conflicts of interest if he continues to hold the chairmanship of the Battersea project. While his tenure will end in September, he might have to leave sooner ... maybe as early as in the first quarter,\u201d says an industry source. Analysts, however, point out that it is up to BPHCL\u2019s board to decide whether or not to retain the tycoon as the chairman. \u201cI\u2019m sure the board is aware of his involvement in property development there,\u201d says an analyst with a local investment bank. Liew had set up EWI after his appointment as non-executive director of Eco World Development Group Bhd (fundamental: 0.3; valuation: 0.95), which was to eventually acquire a 30% stake in the SPAC. \u00a0 In view of the proposed listing of EWI on Bursa Malaysia, EW Investment is prepared to offer the SPAC a right of first refusal to acquire its 75% stake in EcoWorld-Ballymore, says Liew in a statement on the investment. This means EWI might be the first property-related SPAC on the local stock exchange. It will help raise fresh capital for Liew to execute his projects in London while Eco World will concentrate on the domestic market. While EWI is still awaiting approval for its listing from the regulator, the announcement of the multibillion-ringgit projects by EW Investment has got the market talking about its potential. This is because unlike the other SPACs on Bursa Malaysia, EWI will already have a substantial asset base. The other SPACs have typically taken between six months and a year post-listing to make a qualifying acquisition. In other words, investors will know what they are buying into in the case of EWI. EcoWorld-Ballymore will acquire three sites in Central London for a total of \u00a3428.7 million to develop Arrowhead Quay in Canary Wharf, London City Island Phase 2 on the Leamouth Peninsula and Embassy Gardens Phase 2 in Nine Elms. The developer has already secured permission for the planning of Embassy Gardens and outline planning consent for London City Island while a resolution to grant planning consent for Arrowhead Quay was passed on Nov 6 last year. All three projects are expected to be launched this year. \u201cThe projects, which are situated in geographically diversified growth areas offering differentiated pricing points, present an unrivalled opportunity for EcoWorld to introduce its brand name to the Greater London market. \u201cWith our combined and complementary strengths, we believe that the partnership with Ballymore Group can become a strong platform to grow our presence in the UK property market,\u201d says Liew in the statement. Ballymore Group is a property investment and development firm with over 30 years\u2019 experience in the UK and Ireland property markets.

In an announcement with the local bourse today, Sime Darby (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.3) said the Securities Commission of Papua New Guinea (PNG) had on Feb 6, consented to the shortening of the offer period for NBPOL. \"The offer will now close on Feb 23, instead of March 20,\" Sime Darby said. \"As the condition with respect to the European Union (EU) merger filing, as provided in Section 12.1(d) of the Offer Document, had been satisfied on Jan 27, 2015, Sime Darby Plantation is of the view that the extension of the offer period secured through the second notice of variation issued on Jan 6, 2015, is no longer necessary,\" the group added.

Yinson Holdings Bhd (fundamental: 1.5; valuation: 1.5) clinched a US$2.54 billion (RM9.16 billion) floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel charter contract for oil and gas (O&G) support operations in Ghana. The contract was from Italy-based O&G firm Eni S.p.A's unit in Ghana. Yinson said it secured the contract via a consortium comprising Yinson Production (West Africa) Pte Ltd (YPWA)and Yinson Production West Africa Ltd (YPWAL). The contract involves the charter, operation and maintenance of the FPSO facility at the Offshore Cape Three Points Block (OCTP), located in the Tano Basin, which is approximately 60 km off the coast of Ghana.

Under the revised Budget 2015 announced by Najib last Tuesday, the government is seeking an additional RM400 million in dividends from GLCs and GLICs to help supplement its revenue amid falling crude oil prices. On the macro front, the government\u2019s urge for more dividends from such institutions would help shore up investors\u2019 interests, said Areca Capital Sdn Bhd chief executive officer Danny Wong. \u201cWith the government calling for more dividends, this could also hopefully attract foreign funds and indirectly help ease the burden of the weaker ringgit,\u201d Wong told The Edge Financial Daily. However, JF Apex Securities Bhd senior analyst Lee Cherng Wee said whether GLCs could pay more dividends would ultimately depend on their ability to grow earnings substantially amid a tougher economic climate. Already, many research houses are forecasting a mere single-digit corporate earnings growth this year.\u00a0 CIMB Research, for one, is projecting 8% growth in Malaysia\u2019s corporate earnings in 2015, a figure that is nothing to shout about given the projected inflation rate as high as 4% this year, with the impending implementation of the goods and services tax. \u201cIf earnings don\u2019t grow as much, GLCs would then have to increase their payout ratios in response to the government\u2019s needs,\u201d said a head of research.  \u201cSome of the GLCs have big capital expenditure (capex) requirements but if the government asked them to pay more dividends, they will still have to oblige,\u201d he added, citing the case of Petroliam Nasional Bhd. While the national oil firm\u2019s management had expressed its reservations on raising dividends, the government has repeatedly \u201creminded\u201d the former that it makes the ultimate decision on the level of dividends that the national oil firm has to pay. Looking at the list of selected GLCs (see table), most have retained earnings that are multifold of their 12-month trailing net profit.\u00a0 An analyst pointed out that S P Setia Bhd, in which Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) is the major shareholder, is capable of paying a bigger dividend, as there is no major land banking exercise in store in its financial year ending Oct 31, 2015 (FY15). \u201cS P Setia has no big plans so far,\u201d said the analyst. The property developer (fundamental: 1.4; valuation: 1.2) has a dividend policy of distributing at least 50% of its net profit, with its dividend of 9.7 sen per share in FY14 accounting for about 60% of its earnings per share. With retained earnings that were four times its FY14 net profit of RM405.68 million and no major land acquisitions announced, the group looks to be able to distribute more dividends, some said. Meanwhile, another of PNB\u2019s listed conglomerates, Sime Darby Bhd (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.3), has retained earnings of RM28.9 billion, which is 8.59 times its trailing 12-month net profit of RM3.36 billion. In addition, its net gearing level is also low at 0.23 times. Sime Darby has a pending deal to acquire New Britain Palm Oil Ltd for some RM5.63 billion. But after this, analysts don\u2019t expect a major acquisition by the group, at least in the short term. Nevertheless, weak palm oil prices and the slowdown in its China vehicle distribution business may dent Sime Darby\u2019s profitability and crimp its dividends, some said. AllianceDBS Research, in a note last Friday, said companies owned by Khazanah Nasional Bhd are more likely to be the ones asked to pay more dividends, compared with other GLCs that are largely owned by trust funds managed by PNB or the Employees Provident Fund. \u201cIn 2013, Khazanah contributed RM650 million in dividends to the government. This suggests that dividends from Khazanah will need to be ramped up significantly in order to achieve the [additional] RM400 million target,\u201d said the research house in the note. AllianceDBS believes the four GLCs that could give out more dividends are Axiata Group Bhd (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 0.9), Time DotCom Bhd (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 0.6), Petronas Gas Bhd (PetGas) (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 0.9), and MISC Bhd (fundamental: 1.6; valuation: 1.8).\u00a0 Axiata and Time are majority owned by Khazanah, while PetGas and MISC are majority owned by Petronas. \u201cBased on our analysis, Axiata is likely to be the major contributor as it has the capacity to raise its payout ratio from 80% (our current estimate) to 100%, given its strong free cash flow from Malaysian operations. If this happens, this will raise RM205 million in additional dividends for Khazanah,\u201d AllianceDBS explained. JF Apex\u2019s Lee, who tracks telecommunications stocks, said telcos will have to balance between dividend payout and allocation for their capex. \u201cTelcos have high capex commitments because they have to build infrastructure. For Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM), should it get the government\u2019s go-ahead to start its second phase of high-speed broadband this year, its cash might be constrained by the huge capex,\u201d he said. Like Axiata, TM is majority owned by Khazanah. Telcos are seen as dividend-seekers\u2019 favourites due to their stable earnings and generous payout ratios, although currently their yields are in the range of just 4%. Khazanah owns 28.73% of TM (fundamental: 1.1; valuation: 0.9) and 37.89% of Axiata. In the past four financial quarters, TM paid out a dividend of 25.8 sen per share, which is nearly 97% of its earnings per share of 26.61 sen in the same period. Currently, TM has a policy of paying out either RM700 million or a maximum of 90% of its net profit, whichever is higher. Either way, TM\u2019s dividend payout has a limit and is constrained by its performance. Back to Petronas-owned listed companies, while they might be facing earnings headwinds given the depressed crude oil prices, they are lowly geared.\u00a0 Two of them, PetGas and Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd (PChem), are in net cash positions. However, AllianceDBS said that both PetGas and PChem (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 1.2) might be constrained by capex requirements for the Pengerang regasification terminal project and the Refinery And Petrochemical Integrated Development. While no GLC has come out since to declare bumper dividends or bigger payouts, many of the blue-chips have seen their share prices move up.\u00a0 Between last Tuesday and Friday, Axiata rose 22 sen or 3.15% to RM7.21; Sime Darby gained 27 sen or 2.91% to RM9.56; Petronas Dagangan Bhd jumped 86 sen or 5.27% to RM17.18; and PetGas, meanwhile, rose 96 sen or 4.49% to RM22.36. Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB), majority owned by Khazanah, was also instrumental in lifting the benchmark index back to the 1,800 level last week.\u00a0 Save for last Tuesday, the utility giant was consistently in the top gainers rank and it closed the week 60 sen or 4.14% higher to record a fresh high of RM15.10.

A local daily had reported today that the senior management of SP Setia (Fundamental score: 1.4; Valuation score: 1.2) had mooted for the property arm of Sime Darby (Fundamental score: 1.3; Valuation score: 1.6), to acquire the former. It was said this was brought up by the SP Setia\u2019s management two months ago, to Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) and Sime Darby. PNB is the major shareholder of both SP Setia and Sime Darby. CIMB Investment Bank\u2019s analyst Ivy Ng said both SP Setia and Sime Darby Property Bhd \u2014 the unlisted property arm of Sime Darby, have strong assets and earnings to operate independently. \u201cBoth are equipped with sufficient landbank for future endeavours, and both have profitability to boot, with SP Setia\u2019s profitability slightly higher, according to our estimates,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, both can operate independently, on their own, without the need for a merger. \u201cThey will have to come up with good reasons to do this, in order to win over minority shareholders. This is because as a majority shareholder, PNB will not be allowed to vote, as there would be conflict of interest,\u201d she added. The news report, quoting unnamed sources, had stated the idea for Sime Darby Property to acquire SP Setia was mooted to resolve a vacuum in leadership, caused by the departure of SP Setia\u2019s former president and CEO Tan Sri Liew Kee Sin on April 30, 2014. SP Setia\u2019s chief financial officer Datuk Teow Leong Seng, as well as deputy president and chief operating officer Datuk Voon Tin Yow, were supposed to steer the helm of the company into 2015, but both left prematurely. Teow left on July 31, 2014, while Voon left last month. Liew is currently a non-executive director of Bursa Malaysia-listed Eco World Development Group Bhd. It was announced yesterday that he and Voon, through a private company, has signed deals with Ireland\u2019s Ballymore Group to jointly develop property projects in London, worth \u00a32.2 billion. The London projects may be eventually injected into a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that Liew plans to list on Bursa Malaysia. CIMB\u2019s Ng said it is still early days for the merger idea to be treated as a concrete move on the part of SP Setia, Sime Darby and PNB. However, she said based on a \u201cvery rough analysis\u201d, the potential takeover of SP Setia would be accretive for Sime Darby\u2019s earnings. Ng said based on analysis according to SP Setia\u2019s last closing price of RM3.40 and interest for borrowings for the acquisition, Sime Darby can look forward to between 2% to 5% of accretion to earnings. She said this is because the cost of borrowings that Sime Darby would have to undertake to acquire SP Setia, would be lower than the projected earnings from merging with SP Setia. In her note today, she said if Sime Darby does acquire SP Setia, it will have to fork out RM8.5 billion for a 100% stake, based on SP Setia\u2019s last closing price. This represents a sizable 29% of Sime Darby\u2019s total equity. She said the price tag is higher than Sime Darby\u2019s offer to acquire New Britain Palm Oil Ltd (NBPOL) at around RM5.6 billion. \u201cPending finer details of the proposal, our rough estimates see the acquisition as being 5% earnings accretive to Sime Darby, if it acquires SP Setia at a 10% premium to its closing price,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are neutral on this acquisition, which will boost Sime Darby\u2019s property earnings and gearing ratio,\u201d she added. Apart from a common major shareholder in PNB, both Sime Darby and SP Setia have also jointly invested in the successful Battersea Power Station Project in London with 40% stakes each, while the Employee Provident Fund owns the remaining 20%. The estimated gross development value (GDV) of the Battersea project is \u00a38 billion (RM41.69 billion), which may be revised to \u00a310 billion (RM52.11 billion) due to demand and increase in selling prices. Liew is the chairman of the Battersea Project Holding Co Ltd, formed to implement the Battersea Power Station redevelopment project. On whether a merger deal is possibly, Ng said, \u201cI think people are waiting for more details or at least some sort of confirmation that this proposal is actually concrete\u201d. CIMB Investment Bank maintained its \u201cHold\u201d rating on Sime Darby, with a target price of RM9.58. At market close today, shares of Sime Darby rose by 25 sen or 2.73% to RM9.40, while SP Setia rose 4 sen or 1.18% to RM3.43.

They said, however, the lower fourth-quarter earnings outlook should keep upside limited for planters\u2019 share price in the short term. In a note dated Dec 28, CIMB Investment Bank Bhd plantation analyst Ivy Ng Lee Fang sees the floods in the East Coast reducing palm oil output, identifying Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd (FGV), IOI Corp Bhd, Sime Darby Bhd and Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd (KLK) as planters with the highest estate exposure to the states impacted by the floods. \u201cWe expect this event to lift CPO prices in the near term on concerns about palm oil supply. But the upside to CPO prices may be capped by worries over slower global growth, weak crude oil prices and higher soybean supplies,\u201d she said, projecting CPO prices to average at RM2,460 per tonne next year. However, Ng noted that the rise in CPO price may not be sufficient to cover the loss in production from some of the estates impacted by the floods. \u201cAs such, this news is negative for planters that are impacted by the floods. Among the planters under our coverage, FGV currently has the highest proportion (67%) of estates located in the nine states that are reportedly hit by the floods. Sime Darby, IOI Corp and KLK have around 26% to 29% of their total oil palm estates located in these states, followed by Genting Plantations Bhd with 14%,\u201d she said, maintaining a \u201cneutral\u201d rating on the plantation sector. Ng said it is early days to assess the exact impact of the flooding on CPO output as this will be dependent on the severity and length of the ongoing monsoon. It was reported that the Malaysian Palm\u00a0Oil\u00a0Association had forecast CPO production to fall 21% in the Dec 1 to 20 period compared with a month ago. On\u00a0Sept 2, CPO price hit its lowest in five years to RM1,914 per tonne, resulting in the\u00a0 government stepping in to temporarily waive the export levy until December, which has since been extended to end-February next year. Since the temporary suspension, prices have rebounded. Bloomberg reported that prices entered a bullish market on\u00a0Nov 3, after they rose more than 20% from RM1,929 per tonne on\u00a0Aug 29. Low crude oil prices are unlikely to dent CPO prices, said Malaysian Palm Oil Council (MPOC) chairman Datuk Lee Yeow Chor as demand for food outweighs the effects of low crude oil prices. Brent\u00a0oil\u00a0fell to a 5\u00bd-year low under US$57 (RM199.50) per barrel yesterday as persistent worries about a global supply glut offset concerns about output disruptions in\u00a0Libya. \u201cA lot of people put an emphasis on crude oil prices when analysing CPO prices. But the fact is only about 3% of global production of CPO is used for biodiesel,\u201d he told The Edge Financial Daily. \u201cSo the sharply lower price of crude oil will not be a major determining factor for palm oil price,\u201d he said. Lee, who is IOI Corp chief executive officer, foresees CPO prices rallying at RM2,500 per tonne next year due to favourable supply fundamentals for CPO prices. \u201cWe think after January and February onwards supply fundamentals will be favourable to CPO prices. Demand has been very resilient for food,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot depends on the supply [of CPO]. We expect the palm oil stock to decrease in the coming months and more sharply in January and February,\u201d he said, adding that factors affecting palm oil output include the current heavy rainfall in the East Coast. Lee does not expect the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) at 6% in April next year to affect the Malaysian palm oil industry as close to 90% of the supply is exported, which entails a zero rate. \u201cThere will be additional administrative costs, maybe, but otherwise, the GST has minimal impact on the industry,\u201d he said. On government policies that may affect the industry, uncertainties over the proposed capping of foreign ownership to 30% in Indonesian plantation companies may deter oil palm plantation companies from expanding in Indonesia, JF Apex Securities Bhd research analyst Jessica Low Jze Tieng said. She said the proposed policy is unlikely to be revived if newly-elected Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, intends to encourage foreign direct investment in the country. \u201cThe proposed policy has led to the outcry from plantation companies and we see that the uncertainties may lead to the expansion in Indonesia of plantation companies being put on hold,\u201d she told The Edge Financial Daily via email. \u201cIn our view, we think that the proposed policy is unlikely to be resuscitated if the newly- elected Jokowi is to encourage foreign direct investment in the country.\u201d A bill calling for foreign ownership to be limited to 30% in plantations had been mooted in the Indonesian Parliament. Upon opposition from foreign plantation business owners, the bill was passed on Sept 29 this year without the proposed limitation of foreign ownership. The new policy, however, requires Indonesian plantation firms to allocate 20% of their concessions to local residents. It also stipulates that the firms help local smallholders who own plantations and companies be given five years to comply with the new ruling. Low said the research firm is expecting CPO prices to hit RM2,400 per tonne by year-end and to climb up further to RM2,500 per tonne in the first quarter of 2015. This is expected to be due to the low production season coupled with an increased demand for palm oil during the Chinese New Year, she said. Low said the research house anticipates a lower-than-expected CPO production in the coming months as the lagged impact of a dry spell in the first quarter of 2014 would hit production. \u201cCPO production in the first half of 2015 (1H15) may come under pressure on lagged impact of the drought in 2014,\u201d she said. She also said that the shortage of labour remains a challenge in the plantations sector as the booming economy in Indonesia and the competitive plantations industry there had resulted in fewer foreign workers being able to work in Malaysia. The effect is intensified as there has been no concrete solution in addressing the labour issue, she added.

Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd net profit fell 8.33% to RM113.41 million in the third quarter ended Oct 31, 2014 (3QFY15), from RM123.71 million a year ago, due to higher tax expenses, amortisation of software, and higher depreciation of property, plant and equipment. However, the higher tax expenses \u2014 by RM15.1 million \u2014 was primarily due to a reversal in over provision of tax, amounting to RM9.8 million in the corresponding quarter, its filing with Bursa Malaysia today showed. The media and entertainment company has also declared a third interim dividend of 2.25 sen per share, payable next Jan 12. This brings its total dividend for the nine months of FY15 (9MFY15) to 6.75 sen per share, 12.5% higher than 6.0 sen per share in 9MFY14. Quarterly revenue grew 5.24% to RM1.28 billion, from RM1.22 billion a year ago, mainly due to the higher subscriptions and other revenue of RM56.7 million and RM11.7 million respectively, though this was offset by a decrease in advertising revenue of RM4.7 million. For the cumulative nine months (9MFY15), Astro's net profit was 12.73% higher at RM379.4 million, from RM336.56 million in the previous corresponding quarter. Revenue for the period was also up 9.98% to RM3.88 billion, from RM3.53 billion a year ago. Astro closed 1 sen or 0.3% higher at RM3.33, giving it a market capitalisation of RM17.43 billion. The Securities Commission (SC) has approved the withdrawal of Perak Corp Bhd's proposed selective capital reduction (SCR) and repayment exercise, said the company in a Bursa Malaysia filing this evening. The proposal to withdraw the corporate exercise was made by Perbadanan Kemajuan Negeri Perak (PKNP), on behalf of and together with Fast Continent Sdn Bhd, Cherry Blossom Sdn Bhd and Perak Equity Sdn Bhd, in October this year. The proposed withdrawal came after Sime Darby Property Bhd (Sime Property), which holds a substantial stake in the company, indicated in a letter that it would be voting against the exercise, at the extraordinary general meeting that was to be convened in relation to the SCR and repayment. As at June 30, Sime Property, a unit of Sime Darby Bhd, held a 6.13% stake in Perak Corp. The proposed SCR would need at least 50% in the number of entitled shareholders, and 75% in value of the votes held by the entitled shareholders cast in person or proxy at the EGM, according to Perak Corps's announcement to the stock exchange. Sime Property's stake would translate to 13% of the voting shares held. The proposed SCR was to pave way for controlling shareholder PKNP to take the asset-laden company private, at the price of RM3.90 per share. Perak Corp's share price took a nosedive after the announcement on the proposed withdrawal, tumbling from RM3.60 to RM2.39 today, with a market capitalisation of RM242 million. Meanwhile, the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) has continued its shopping spree for shares in the upstream oil and gas (O&G) player, SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd, with a purchase of 6.26 million shares in the latter. This brings the provident fund\u2019s shareholding in SapuraKencana to 13.48% as at Dec 8, 2014, the date of the acquisition. EPF has been on a buying spree for SapuraKencana shares, after several positive news flow from the oil and gas group recently. On Monday (Dec 8), SapuraKencana revealed improved financial performance for the third quarter ended Oct 31, 2014 (3Q15). It recorded a nearly 42% jump in net profits to RM348.4 million, while its revenue grew 1.2% to RM2.41 billion year-on-year. Prior to that on Dec 5 (Friday), the company had announced it has been awarded contracts with a combined value of approximately RM1.58 billion. SapuraKencana closed at RM2.37 today, down half a sen.

Mokhzani, who has earlier trimmed his stake in the oil & gas group, bought back some shares today, through his private investment vehicle Kencana Capital Sdn Bhd. With the latest share purchase, Mokhzani\u2019s shareholding increased to 607 million or 10.13%, while his direct interest stood at 9.49 million shares or 0.16%. It is learnt that Mokhzani intends to continue accumulating shares, given the attractive valuation after the recent meltdown on most O&G stocks. His move to raise stake in SapuraKencana is as surprised as when he sold part of his stake and relinquished his executive role in the group in February. The share purchase has made some quarters puzzled, as Mokhzani\u2019s share sale earlier, has reinforced the belief he would concentrate his investment in Yinson Holdings Bhd.

The state-controlled planter, which was the second largest initial public offering to Facebook Inc in 2012, lost RM52 million from derivative contracts in its Canadian business for the quarter. \"This was clearly a direct consequence of a drastic increase in the exposure to risky and volatile trading instruments. \"FGVH\u2019s investment in commodity futures increased sharply from a mere RM118,500 as at September last year to a whopping RM1.15 billion for the current period,\" the Petaling Jaya MP, who is also the DAP national publicity secretary, said in a statement. He added FGVH dabbled with foreign currency forward contracts, increasing its exposure from just RM233,000 to RM1.2 billion over the same period. \"The shareholders of FGVH, including Felda, Lembaga Tabung Haji and Employees Provident Fund must be concerned about the substantial increase in the risk exposure, which is big enough to cripple the entire FGV group.\" Pua questioned if the plantation company \u2013 which made a stunning debut on the stock exchange more than two years ago \u2013 will go down the same road as flag carrier Malaysian Airline System (MAS) which has been nationalised. In its latest filing, FGVH reported its first quarterly loss of RM12 million for the quarter ending September 2014. The counter closed at RM3.08 yesterday, registering a decline of 42.9% since its listing in June 2012. Pua said that FGVH's nine-months\u2019 results only achieved 53% of the market consensus full year profit forecast, significantly disappointing\u00a0 investors. He added that the results also showed\u00a0 a clear drop in productivity, where FGVH reduced its total palm fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production by 1% in the 9-months of 2014, despite having added about 5% of additional mature palm oil area from the RM1.2 billion acquisition of Pontian United Plantations last year. Pua said FGVH blamed the decline in productivity on the lower rainfall, but added that the excuse could not hold water given that in comparison, Malaysia\u2019s average FFB production increased by 3% over the same period. He pointed out that the latest analyst report by CIMB on FGVH on Nov 27\u00a0 was damning, where the bank downgraded the stock from a \u201cHold\u201d to a \u201cSell\u201d. Pua said in October, the Ministry of Finance had responded to his question of the increasingly weak financial performance by FGVH by attributing it entirely to the falling commodity prices. But, he added that he said in October if the terrible performance of FGVH was solely attributable to crude palm oil prices, then all other plantation companies will be afflicted with the same poor performance. Instead he pointed out then that FGVH was the worst performer of all plantation stocks listed on Bursa Malaysia over six months. Based on data as at 15 October 2014, FGVH stock price dropped by 29.1% compared against its peers \u2013 IJM Plantations (-6.3%), IOI Corp (-2.7%), Genting Plantatins (-9.4%) and Sime Darby (-1.6%). The closest poor performer was KL Kepong whose price dropped by 16.6% over the same period. \"Therefore, with the latest results, it is clear that the worsening performance is caused by factors well beyond just falling commodity prices,\" Pua said. He added that while the company may remain profitable for the current financial year, the signs are clear of a consistent deteriorating performance. He urged FGVH chairman Tan Sri Isa Samad and the top management to take collective responsibility of the company's declining results. He added that this was especially so since\u00a0 FGVH in its 2012 Annual Report boasted that\u00a0 'FGVH\u2019s stunning debut on the main market in Bursa Malaysia in 2012 was a global sensation.\u00a0 This is just the start of our metamorphosis into a global powerhouse'. \"Datuk Seri Najib Razak, as both the finance and prime minister, who promised Felda settlers the stars during the listing exercise must therefore take decisive and immediate actions to stem the decline in the company. \"Otherwise, the latest loss incurred by FGVH may signal the start of another winding road to financial collapse just like the Malaysian Airlines System.\" \u2013 The Malaysian Insider"}, "266": {"date_posted": "13/11/2014", "title": "Maxis, GD Express Carriers, Sime Darby, Econpile Holdings, Rex Industry, I-Bhd, and K-Star Sports", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 11): Based on corporate announcements and news flow today, the companies that may be in focus tomorrow (Friday, Nov 14) could be the following: Maxis Bhd, GD Express Carriers Bhd, Sime Darby Bhd, Econpile Holdings Bhd, Rex Industry Bhd, I-Bhd, and K-Star Sports Ltd.

Earnings per share (EPS) surged to 6.23 sen for the quarter under review, from 1.17 sen previously. \u00a0 For the nine month period ended Sept 30 (9MFY14), I-Bhd's net profit expanded by 176.23% to RM39.75 million, from RM14.39 million, while revenue grew almost double to RM192.95 million, from RM96.49 million a year ago. The property developer attributed the improved earnings to higher percentage of recognition for both the project completion and sales for i-Residence, i-SOVO, i-SOHO and i-Suites projects. \"Baring any unforeseen circumstances and based on the aforementioned factors, the board is confident that it would achieve better operating results for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2014,\" it added. I-Bhd closed 1 sen higher at 72.5 sen, giving it a market capitalisation of RM507.39 million. K-Star Sports Ltd has narrowed its net loss by 83% to RM5.5 million in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2014 (3QFY14), from RM32.9 million in the previous corresponding quarter. The smaller loss came on a \u201cstable\u201d overall gross profit margin, as its average selling price and production costs saw no major fluctuation, said the sports footwear firm in a filing with Bursa Malaysia today. Revenue rose 7.7% to RM43.3 million, from RM40.2 million a year earlier. K-Star said sales of Dixing brand footwear has improved, but sales of original equipment manufacturer products and apparel have deteriorated. For the nine-month period (9MFY14), net loss narrowed 58% to RM15.3 million from RM36.6 million a year ago, while revenue fell 8.6% to RM121.9 million, from RM133.5 million in the same period last year. K-Star fell half sen or 3.7% to 13 sen today, with 311,800 shares traded, giving it a market capitalisation of RM35.96 million."}, "267": {"date_posted": "5/11/2014", "title": "Trade Wise: Will Kulim pay special dividends from sale of NBPOL?", "article": " THE PAPUA NEW GUINEA (PNG) government has given Sime Darby Bhd\u2019s proposal to acquire New Britain Palm Oil Ltd (NBPOL) its blessing. The question is, will Kulim (M) Bhd, which will be selling its 49% stake in the Papuan palm oil producer, distribute all the proceeds from the disposal to its shareholders? Last Thursday, Sime Darby surprised the market by announcing that its subsidiary, Sime Darby Plantation Sdn Bhd, intends to make a cash offer of \u00a37.15 apiece for all the voting shares in NBPOL. Note that this was just a week after Sime Darby said it was not proceeding with the acquisition following the expiry of the exclusivity period agreed between the parties. Given that Kulim had previously distributed the entire RM1.16 billion proceeds from the disposal of its stake in QSR Brands Bhd and KFC (M) Holdings Bhd, the market appears to believe it will do the same this time around. Kulim\u2019s shares rose 4.62% to close at RM3.40 last Friday. However, an MIDF Research analyst opines that Kulim needs to hold on to some of the proceeds to expand its businesses, especially in the plantation segment. This is because the disposal of NBPOL will leave a big hole in Kulim\u2019s future earnings. \u201cKulim needs to use the proceeds for capital expenditure. It needs to keep some of the money to expand its plantation business because NBPOL contributes a huge part of the segment\u2019s profit,\u201d the analyst tells The Edge. Kulim\u2019s plantation businesses in PNG and the Solomon Islands contribute about 30% to the segment\u2019s operating profit. The operating profit of the plantation segment is bigger than the group\u2019s total operating profit (see table). In 2013, NBPOL contributed 70% and 65% of Kulim\u2019s fresh fruit bunches (FFB) and crude palm oil (CPO) production \u2014 Kulim produced 563,984 tonnes of FFB and 180,664 tonnes of CPO. \u201cThe planned divestment of NBPOL may significantly affect Kulim\u2019s plantation performance as 65% of the group\u2019s FFB production was contributed by the operation in PNG and the Solomon Islands. If the sale of NBPOL goes through, we expect Kulim\u2019s earnings growth in the near term to be muted,\u201d states MIDF Research in a Sept 19 report. The research house says that part of the proceeds from the NBPOL sale will be utilised to finance the development of the newly acquired 40,645ha greenfield plantation land in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Kulim targets to plant 400ha by end of this year, notes MIDF Research. However, as the Central Kalimantan land is a greenfield project, Kulim will not reap much from it for at least the next two to three years. Thus, Kulim needs to find a way to plug the hole if it wants to maintain its level of earnings, says the analyst with MIDF Research. Nevertheless, others expect Kulim to distribute the entire proceeds to its shareholders. This is because its largest shareholder, Johor Corp Bhd (JCorp), with a 60.3% stake, would want the proceeds to be distributed so that it can pare down its debts. While JCorp has a large portfolio of assets, it also has huge debts. Besides QSR and KFC, JCorp owns stakes in Damansara Realty Bhd, KPJ Healthcare Bhd, Damansara Assets Sdn Bhd, Johor Land Bhd and Tanjung Langsat Port Sdn Bhd, among others. As at Dec 31, 2013, JCorp had RM8.63 billion of property, plant and equipment, RM3.55 billion in investment properties and RM1.27 billion of investment in joint ventures. The group had cash and bank balances amounting to RM1.11 billion last year. On the other side of the balance sheet, short and long-term borrowings stood at RM1.63 billion and RM6.93 billion respectively. Another analyst says he sees the likelihood of the proceeds from the sale of NBPOL to be distributed to Kulim\u2019s shareholders via a special dividend, amounting to about RM2.20 per share. \u201cRecall that Kulim paid a special dividend of 93 sen when it disposed of its stake in QSR and KFC in 2012,\u201d he says. The analyst points out that if Kulim needs to acquire new assets or businesses to plug the hole left by NBPOL, the group could easily raise the funds. As at June 30, 2014, Kulim\u2019s gearing stood at 37.7%. It had cash and bank balances of RM248.9 million as at June 30, 2014, while total loans and borrowings stood at RM2.03 billion. However, its borrowings are also expected to go down, as about 40% of the total was NBPOL\u2019s debts. Besides its plantation business, Kulim also has shipping and oil and gas-related businesses. The proposed listing of its shipping arm, EA Technique (M) Bhd, could provide greater financial flexibility for Kulim to pursue its investment strategy, says MIDF Research. While it will be good news for Kulim\u2019s shareholders if the group decides to distribute the proceeds from the sale of NBPOL, there is a chance it may not do so, or may not distribute the entire amount to shareholders. If the latter happens, it will be hard to justify the almost 5% jump in Kulim\u2019s share price last Friday, notes the analyst with MIDF Research. NBPOL deal long-term positive for Sime Darby Sime Darby Bhd has made an offer of \u00a37.15 (RM37.34) per share for New Britain Palm Oil Ltd (NBPOL). Sime Darby\u2019s offer is said to be around 10% higher than that of the other bidders, say sources. The question is whether Sime Darby will be overpaying for the acquisition, at an 85% premium of NBPOL\u2019s closing price of \u00a33.87 per share traded on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) on Oct 8, the last trading day before the announcement. According to Maybank Investment Bank Research, the quality of NBPOL\u2019s assets and management, scarcity of landbank, and the high cost and high risk of greenfield development, led to the proposed acquisition. Besides being 100% certified as a sustainable palm oil producer by the Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), NBPOL will provide a gateway for Sime Darby\u2019s expansion into Papua New Guinea (PNG), says the investment bank. \u00a0 The government of PNG has stated its intention to hold a 30% stake in NBPOL, pursuant to the privatisation of the company off the LSE. NBPOL will be relisted on either Bursa Malaysia or the Singapore Exchange. \u201cThe offer price translates to an earning value per mature hectare (EV per ha) of RM84,200, or about a 15% premium to recent transactions in Malaysia. On its short term financial impact, we are neutral to slight negative on the acquisition.\u201d The EV per ha of RM84,200 is the highest offered for a listed entity so far. Just last month, Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd\u2019s offer for Asia Plantations Ltd worked out to an EV per ha of RM75,000, according to CIMB Investment Bank Research. It is worth noting that NBPOL\u2019s estates recorded an average fresh fruit bunch yield of 23.5 tonnes per ha and an oil extraction rate of 22.5% over the past five years, which is superior to most of its peers, added CIMB in a report last Friday. \u201cWe are long term positive on the deal given the potential synergies and opportunities in Papua New Guinea for future expansion. Sime Darby gains an immediate foothold in this new market [with the acquisition],\u201d says Maybank IB. NBPOL has over 78,000ha of planted oil palm plantations with a further 10,000ha for future planting, over 7,700ha of sugar cane plantations, and more than 9,000ha of grazing pasture. The company also owns 12 mills and two refineries in PNG and in Liverpool, in the UK. Another analyst opines that the acquisition will have minimal earnings impact on Sime Darby. He estimates an almost zero earnings accretion after taking into account the loss of interest income from the internal funds utilised for the acquisition and additional borrowing costs. \u201c[Sime Darby\u2019s] management has provided guidance of 4% to 5% accretion in two years, based on a CPO (crude palm oil) price assumption of US$800 per tonne or approximately RM2,600 per tonne. We believe upside would come from landbank expansion in Papua New Guinea or synergies extracted from the exercise,\u201d says the analyst. Nevertheless, NBPOL\u2019s Liverpool refinery will complement Sime Darby\u2019s existing downstream business in Europe, said UOB KayHian in a research note last Friday. \u201cThe Liverpool refinery supplies about 95% of traceable sustainable palm oil to the UK market with good premium pricing. The UK is a totally new market for Sime Darby as it only has one refinery in the Netherlands,\u201d it wrote. With the Liverpool refinery, Sime Darby\u2019s total capacity in the region will increase to 750,000 tonnes per annum, said the research firm. The traceability of NBPOL\u2019s palm oil products as sustainable is also good branding for Sime Darby to capture the European market, it added.\u00a0 \u2014 By Kamarul Azhar \nThis article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on October 13 - 19, 2014."}, "268": {"date_posted": "4/11/2014", "title": "#edGY: How to find out what you are worth", "article": " EVER looked at your pay cheque and wonder if you are being paid enough? Are you underpaid for the amount of work that you do? Or, might you even be overpaid for doing what an intern can manage? Unfortunately, there are no simple answers to these questions. And, there are no formulas that can calculate what a fair wage is. Salary comparisons are relative on so many different levels. On a macro level, one\u2019s salary depends on the country you work in, the health of the economy, the industry\u2019s landscape as well as the size and type of company you work for. There are also demand and supply forces at play. On a more personal level, it depends on your qualifications, skills and experience as well as employee benefits and career development opportunities. Also, how well you have negotiated your remuneration package. To find out how much others are getting paid for doing the same job, the simplest way is to ask your peers, both in and outside your organisation. Nevertheless, some people are uncomfortable in disclosing how much they earn. If you fail to get answers this way, try these other methods to get an estimate of how much you could be earning. This week, #edGY searched for salary reports, websites and apps to satisfy that curiosity. App/Report:\nThe Robert Walters Salary Checker\nGlobal recruitment company Robert Walters has a nifty mobile app, called Salary Checker 2014, which is free and available on the App Store and Google Play. The data is based on its comprehensive Global Salary Survey 2014 report and saves you the trouble of going through the 499-page document. The app allows users to select their country of workplace from a list of 25 nations and two regions \u2014 the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa. Malaysia is among the countries listed, alongside the likes of Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore, the US, the UK and Indonesia. This is useful if your present job is in the corporate sector. There are only seven industries or \u201cspecialisms\u201d listed: accounting and finance, banking and financial services, human resources, information technology, legal and compliance, sales and marketing, and supply chain and engineering. Some specialisms allow users to specify their expertise, sector and job title. Using this app, we tried to look up the salary comparisons for an auditor in Kuala Lumpur. The app displays a simple bar chart of the annual salaries in ringgit for an auditor over three years. For 2014, the app tells us that an auditor typically earns between RM48,000 and RM102,000 a year. That\u2019s a significant jump from the RM48,000 to RM88,000 range for 2012 and 2013. This app gives a quick overview of the salary ranges for specific jobs in certain industries in different countries. Data source is important and we take comfort in the comprehensive global survey as its base. But where the app disappoints is that it does not allow for deeper customisation based on years of experience, size of organisation, bonus and other employee benefits. App/Report:\nHays APAC Salary Guide\nRecruitment specialist Hays publishes an annual salary guide that is easily the most comprehensive around. Various industries are covered in this report: accountancy and finance; banking; construction, architecture and engineering; contact centres; education; energy; healthcare; human resources; information technology; insurance; legal; life sciences; logistics manufacturing and operations; office support; oil and gas; policy and strategy; procurement; property and facility management; resources and mining; retail; and sales and marketing. Hays has also made it easier to browse its salary guide by offering a free mobile app for iOS devices. The app\u2019s interface is simple to use and covers a wide breadth of industries across Asia. Users can find out typical salaries by selecting the country, industry, sector and position. Malaysia is one of the countries included in this report and app. For those without Apple devices, there is a full report available for free download upon request. The report offers country-specific salary and recruitment trends for each of the industries. What is most valuable are the in-depth average salary listings for specific jobs and specialities, seniority and size of company (SMEs, mid-size and multinationals). For example, the report shows that a senior associate or assistant manager of audit in Malaysia typically earns RM72,000 to RM108,000 a year while a senior manager takes home between RM144,000 and RM204,000 in 2014. At a glance, readers can see what a similar executive in Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore can earn. Website:\nGlassdoor\nGlassdoor is a US-based job listing site that allows employees to anonymously review their employers, salaries and interview process. It was the glimpse into other people\u2019s salaries that generated a lot of buzz and controversy when Glassdoor was launched in June 2007. The site has gained traction in the US, but not quite in Asia. Nevertheless, international expansion is on the cards. Users in Malaysia might be pleased to know that data has been submitted for 3,849 salaries and 1,900 companies. The catch is that users have to sign up for a free account or log in via their Facebook or Google accounts to view the full list of salaries. Once you get past that, you will find Glassdoor\u2019s salary information rather fascinating and useful as a guide. But be mindful that Glassdoor does not verify the submissions as the information is volunteered by its users. At a click, users can see the different salaries for different jobs in many big companies. These include the Big Four accounting firms, major telecommunications companies, banks, national oil company Petroliam Nasional Bhd, Intel Corp, Bursa Malaysia, Genting Group, Sime Darby and Starbucks. There are a lot of details in the salary reviews: they tell you the company, role, average salary and the pay range for a certain job. It also shows the number of employees at that level who have submitted information to generate what is displayed on Glassdoor. For example, Glassdoor claims that in Malaysia, a senior associate in audit at PricewaterhouseCoopers earns an average of RM52,905 a year, although it can range from RM40,000 to RM70,000 a year. This works out to RM4,221 a month, but at that level, salaries can range from RM3,300 to RM5,000. It also shows that the average senior associate at PwC gets a bonus of about RM8,000 a year. Apart from salaries and bonuses, there are options for reviewers to disclose their stock bonus and profit-sharing, if applicable. Website:\nPayScale.com\nOver the last 12 years, PayScale.com has been gathering and evaluating data on job market compensation. Unlike Glassdoor, PayScale does not just rely on reviews. There is a methodology to it. PayScale starts with its salary survey for people who are weighing up a job offer, evaluating their current salary or researching other jobs. Data from each survey is cleansed, analysed and run through its MarketMatch algorithm to make compensation predictions for individuals based on different factors. The data-crunching capabilities and salary survey reports are what makes PayScale such a useful resource for jobseekers. This survey saves you the trouble of browsing through lots of salary listings. But it does take a good 15 minutes to answer several questions about your current earnings, what your role entails, how many people you manage, the employee benefits and leave days entitled and your qualifications. PayScale promises that its salary report compares your pay cheque with that of other people with similar education, skills and experience. It will tell you exactly where you stand on the scale and advise you on how to move up the ranks, perhaps by moving to another city or gunning for a promotion or personal improvement. Beware, though. This survey only works if you are having a job that other people are likely to have. Otherwise, you will come to the end of the survey with no report shown.

Mistry, who\u2019s traded edible oils for more than three decades, said in September that it was a good time to buy palm oil companies, without identifying individual stocks, and reiterated that call at the conference.

REDtone\u2019s board are of the opinion that the amounts are recoverable and accordingly, no impairment has been made in the financial statements.\nWhile management strongly believes the amounts are recoverable despite being long outstanding, the news could have some negative consequences for the share price in the near term.\nWe understand that the group had earlier targeted to apply for a transfer to the Main Board following the release of its FY14 audited account. Nevertheless, in view of the above qualified opinion made by the external auditor, we expect some hiccups in the process. We believe REDtone\u2019s businesses are not expected to see any material impact should the group fail to transfer its listing status. Sime Darby Bhd\nFair value: RM11.20 BUY AMINVESTMENT RESEARCH (Oct 1): Sime Darby has aborted its plan to acquire a 49% stake in New Britain Palm Oil Ltd (NBPOL) from Kulim (M) Bhd after holding exclusive talks with the latter. We believe the stumbling blocks could be the pricing and questions over Sime Darby\u2019s ability to exert control over NBPOL, which is now largely independently managed apart from Kulim. We are neutral on this latest development.\nAt the current price of \u00a34.175 per share, NBPOL is trading at a PER of 16 times the consensus FY14F EPS of \u00a30.26 per share. At a premium of 30% to 50% over the current price (\u00a35.40 to \u00a36.30 per share), NBPOL would be valued at 21 times and 24 times its FY14F EPS \u2014 which is on the steep side. This would have translated into a purchase price of RM4.3 billion to RM5 billion for Sime Darby to assume full control of NBPOL. Nonetheless, we believe the long-term prospects remain intact, and the stock will benefit from any upticks in the crude palm oil price. Petra Energy Bhd\nTarget price: RM3.02 NEUTRAL RHB RESEARCH (Oct 1): Recall that Petra Energy had been awarded a five-year RM2.5 billion hook-up, construction and commissioning (HuCC) and topside major maintenance (TMM) contract from Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd, from May 2013 to May 2018. The HuCC part of the contract has seen activities slowly ramping up while the TMM portion has now been activated \u2014 earlier than the expected February 2016 start date. We estimate that 11% of the total value of the complete contract will be registered in FY14. As the TMM portion of the contract is on a \u201ccall-out\u201d basis, and given the slow ramping up of activities in the HuCC part, we believe our backloaded earnings for the contract is justified.\nPetra Energy was awarded a risk service contract by Petronas to operate the Kapal, Banang, and Meranti (KBM) cluster in partnership with Coastal Energy Ltd. We believe with the early start to the TMM portion of the contract and the successful operation of the KBM cluster, Petra Energy has done well to turn itself around. VS Industry Bhd\nTarget price: RM2.92 BUY RHB RESEARCH (Oct 1): VSI\u2019s FY14 earnings of RM53.6 million exceeded our and consensus estimates. Its exceptional performance was achieved on the back of better earnings from its Malaysian operation and tax incentives for its exported coffee machines.\nAlthough its turnover in Malaysia grew just 5.7% y-o-y, its PBT surged 78.7% y-o-y on the back of an improved sales mix, particularly contribution from the higher-margin coffee machines.\nA 3.5 sen third interim dividend was declared, which will be followed by a final dividend of 3.5 sen at a later date, bringing the total FY14 gross dividend per share to 11.7 sen. In view of the better-than-expected FY14 earnings, we raise our earnings forecasts for FY15 by 60% on contributions from the sale of existing coffee machine models, contribution from the sale of a new coffee machine model by 4QFY15, and remaining tax incentives of RM15 million that will be utilised in FY15. Gamuda Bhd\nFair value: RM5.40 BUY AMINVESTMENT RESEARCH (Sept 30): Gamuda\u2019s core FY14 net profit rose 9% y-o-y on higher construction and property earnings. The work progress for KVMRT Line 1 under the MMC-Gamuda joint venture has reached 52% and 35% for the tunnelling and project delivery partner (PDP) components respectively. Core property earnings surged 19% y-o-y on the strong pre-sales trajectory in the last two financial years and stable margins. New property sales fell 55% y-o-y to RM300 million in 4Q, nudging total new sales upwards by 3% to RM1.8 billion.\nGamuda has been reshaping its landbank by acquiring strategic township land during the current lull. More landbanking moves are possible within a year \u2014 about RM1.3 billion has been set aside in search of more land, including in Penang. Gamuda\u2019s track record as the PDP for KVMRT1 puts it in good stead to bid for a similar role under the Penang government\u2019s transport master plan, which could be awarded by mid-2015.

All these vessels are expected to be delivered in FY14 and FY15. We are positive on this contract as it shows that Coastal is able to secure contract wins in a consistent manner. This current sale award brings its cumulative FY14 vessel sales to RM802 million and shipping order book to RM1.4 billion.\nThis contract comes within our assumed RM1.2 billion shipbuilding order replenishment. The shipbuilding division is currently riding the cyclical upward trend. Although net margins have normalised to between 15% and 25% from FY12 onwards, the shipbuilding industry is still considered lucrative. Coastal\u2019s maiden jack-up rig is due for delivery by end-2H14. There have been no contracts awarded as yet, but these assets will spearhead the company\u2019s move into asset-ownership model versus the previous build-and-sell model.

Work will begin in mid-October.\nWe are also encouraged by Naga 6\u2019s daily charter rate of US$150,000 to US$160,000, after deducting mobilisation costs, as it is higher than the current market average of US$140,000 to US$150,000. All of UMW-OG\u2019s jack-ups are contracted, except Naga 8, the construction of which is expected to be completed in September 2015.\nUMW-OG\u2019s only other jack-up that is still at the yard is Naga 7, which will start servicing a 120-day, US$20 million contract from Frontier Oil Ltd in the Philippines in January 2015. It aims to venture beyond Southeast Asia in FY15 and targets the Middle East as a potential key market. Genting Malaysia Bhd\nTarget price: RM5.15 BUY MAYBANK INVESTMENT BANK RESEARCH (Sept 29): The poor 2Q14 Ebitda of RM460.4 million was due to low VIP win rates at Resorts World Genting (RWG) and Genting UK (GENUK). We estimate that 2Q14 group Ebitda would have been about RM665 million or 45% higher on normalised VIP win rates at RWG and GENUK. Therefore, we believe investors should not be overly concerned.\nWe are increasingly convinced that GENM will win a prized upstate New York commercial casino licence as it is offering the highest amount of investment into the project, highest amount of licensing fees and/or tax rates and highest number of jobs and salaries. Despite committing to investing more and paying more licensing fees, we estimate that an upstate New York licence will accrete at least a net 47 sen per share.\nWinners will be announced by November at the latest. In the unlikely event that GENM does not win a single licence, our base case SOP-based target price of RM4.70 still offers a 13% upside. Hiap Teck Venture Bhd\nTarget price: 92 sen BUY AFFIN HWANG CAPITAL (Sept 29): Hiap Teck\u2019s 4Q14 revenue grew 3.7% y-o-y, underpinned by its trading division. Volume from its trading business grew 12.6% y-o-y but was offset by lower average selling prices on stiff competition. Contribution from its manufacturing business fell slightly, also due to price competition.\nDespite the revenue growth, the group\u2019s pre-tax profit was down 43% y-o-y on the back of pricing pressure. Ebitda margin fell 1.6 percentage points y-o-y to 2%.\nWe expect international prices to remain under pressure on the back of a moderating global economic growth. However, we believe the impact will be partially cushioned as we expect domestic demand for steel products to remain buoyant on the back of existing and upcoming construction and infrastructure projects. Maintain \u201cbuy\u201d with an unchanged target price of 92 sen, still based on 12 times CY15 PER. Sasbadi Holdings Bhd\nTarget price: RM2.25 BUY ALLIANCE DBS RESEARCH (Sept 29): Sasbadi\u2019s proceeds from its initial public offering puts it in a prime position to embark on earnings-accretive mergers and acquisitions in the fragmented educational publishing industry. In addition, there is a huge potential in the untapped educational services market, in particular hands-on learning centres that foster creative thinking and innovation, where Sasbadi could be the missing piece of the puzzle in Malaysia\u2019s education industry.\nWe forecast Sasbadi\u2019s FY15 to FY17 core profit after tax will expand at a three-year CAGR of 22%, underpinned by earnings accretive M&As. Valuation is undemanding at 11 times, 9 times and 7 times FY15 to FY17 EPS, while yields are attractive at 5% to 7%.\nWe initiate coverage of Sasbadi with a high-conviction \u201cbuy\u201d. Our target price implies 16 times FY15 EPS, and suggests a total return of 55% from the last close of RM1.50. Cypark Resources Bhd\nTarget price: RM3.09 ADD CIMB INVESTMENT RESEARCH (Sept 30): Revenue in 3Q14 increased 24% y-o-y to RM66.6 million, driven by growth in its landscaping, infrastructure and construction division, which almost tripled y-o-y to RM13.1 million during the quarter. Its renewable energy (RE) division continued to post strong growth, expanding 56% y-o-y during the quarter and implying more sales of electricity to the grid.\nCypark\u2019s Ladang Tanah Merah concession is expected to start soon. The concession period is for 25 years, during which Cypark will open, maintain and close the landfill in Negeri Sembilan. The waste will also act as feedstock for the next phase of Cypark\u2019s project, which is to generate electricity using biogas or biomass. The electricity generated will then be sold to Tenaga Nasional Bhd.\nWe continue to be positive about Cypark\u2019s RE prospects, underpinned by the country\u2019s RE aspirations. Given Cypark\u2019s position as the only major RE developer, we believe it is in a prime position to capitalise on any new RE projects.

Biodiesel demand plays an important role in supporting the CPO price. At the current crude oil price, the wide gap between the CPO price and crude oil price has led to more demand for biodiesel.\nThe refining margin in Indonesia has since normalised, and it is now feeling the margin pressure that Malaysia is experiencing. KLK has two refineries in commission in Indonesia with a total capacity of 3,000 tonnes per day. Back in February, KLK entered into a joint venture with UEM Sunrise Bhd to develop two projects in Iskandar Malaysia. Management is expecting contribution from these two projects to come in in two to three years\u2019 time and this would be a focus for KLK going forward, in addition to its Bandar Seri Coalfields township development.

Pursuant to the completion of the takeover by end-2014, Sime Darby Plantation Sdn Bhd\u2019s enlarged land bank would measure about one million hectares. Sime Darby reiterated that the offer is in line with its strategy blueprint to expand the land bank of Sime Darby Plantation, while NBPOL, with its brownfield assets, is expected to contribute immediately to earnings without the incumbent risk associated with a greenfield expansion. It said the offer is expected to result in potential synergies between the group and NBPOL by way of expansion into the upstream and downstream sectors, combined research and development facilities, and new growth opportunities in PNG. The offer will be financed via internal funds and borrowings, the exact quantum of which cannot yet be ascertained as the final amount will be dependent on the level of acceptances.

The filing also said it has received a formal offer document from Sime Darby Plantation today, to acquire its NBPOL stake at an offer price of GBP7.15 per share or RM37.47. The offer price is at a premium of 85% to NBPOL\u2019s last closing price of GBP3.87 on Oct 8, at the London Stock Exchange. It\u00a0also represents a massive gain for Kulim, whose original cost of investment of the 73.48 million shares is approximately RM216.39 million. \u00a0It had originally acquired 96 million NBPOL shares for RM282.71 million in 1996, but has since disposed of 22.52 million shares with a cumulative gain of about RM113.35 million.\u00a0 Kulim\u2019s board of directors had expressed on Oct 9, that it intended to accept the offer from Sime Darby Plantation if there were no other superior offer. The company will now put the proposed disposal to the shareholders, at an extraordinary general meeting to be convened at a later date."}, "281": {"date_posted": "14/10/2014", "title": "Brokers' Digest: Local Equities", "article": " Local Equities AEON Co (M) Bhd\nTarget price: RM3.65 HOLD\nMAYBANK RESEARCH (Sept 17): The weakness in AEON\u2019s 2QFY14 results was largely due to factors such as higher advertising and promotional expenses incurred for its 30th anniversary celebration, higher electricity costs after the average 17% tariff hike in January, store renovation expenses, and opening costs associated with its Bukit Mertajam store.\nGenerally, sales have held up with growth in same-store sales of 4% y-o-y in 2Q14, aided in large part by new store openings. Results in 3QFY14 are likely to remain seasonally weak and there will still be renovation costs, but to a lesser extent. However, a strong y-o-y pick-up should be seen in 4QFY14, particularly since 4QFY13 had been a weak quarter. Property management income has thus far sustained its momentum and will continue to do so given the steady pace of new store openings.\nTaking into account the potential for a stronger 4Q14, we have raised our FY14 net profit forecast by 5% while trimming our FY15 forecast by 1% to account for slower retail sales next year. Berjaya Food Bhd\nFair value: RM3.05 HOLD\nAMRESEARCH (Sept 17): We reaffirm our \u201chold\u201d recommendation on BFood with an unchanged fair value of RM3.05 per share, pegged to a PER of 25 times CY15F earnings.\nBFood registered 1QFY15 core net profit of RM6 million, which is in line with our expectations. Core net profit for the quarter accounts for a small fraction of our full-year estimate of RM34 million at 18%. This is because our estimate includes the seven months earnings contribution from the full consolidation of Starbucks Coffee Sdn Bhd (BStarbucks) from end-September onwards. Post the completion of the acquisition of BStarbucks, we expect this high-growth segment to contribute to 54% of revenue in FY15F.\nBFood\u2019s 1QFY15 top-line growth was driven by higher revenue generated at all of its key operating markets and maiden contribution from Kenny Rogers Roasters in Cambodia, despite the Muslim fasting month during the quarter. While the stock is trading at a high forward PER of 30 times FY15F, the full-year earnings contributions from the consolidation of BStarbucks will be reflected from FY16F onwards. MISC Bhd\nFair value: RM7.21 NEUTRAL\nRHB RESEARCH (Sept 15): The outlook for petroleum shipping is looking positive as supply remains tight, notably on Aframaxes and very large crude carriers where MISC stands to benefit.\nFive of MISC\u2019s LNG vessels are near contract expiry, from 2014 to 2017. With spot rates on a downward trend in the near term, the secured rates could be US$48,000 a day \u2014 about 40% lower than its previous rates. We estimate that earnings over the next few years could be flattish at best. The LNG division is expected to contribute to 78% and 70% of earnings in FY14F and FY15F respectively.\nWe nudge up our FY14 earnings by 7% on higher petroleum tanker earnings but lower our FY15 earnings by 4% on lower-than-expected contribution from Cendor and the tank terminal side. We raise our SOP fair value to RM7.21 as we reduce our net debt by 28%. This gives it an implied 16.2 times FY15 PER \u2014 near the tanker shipping players\u2019 average of 16.9 times FY15 PER. YTL Power International Bhd\nTarget price: RM1.84 BUY\nAFFIN INVESTMENT BANK (Sept 17): We believe YTLP\u2019s 10 sen dividend per share is sustainable given our annual free cash flow forecast of RM403 million to RM566 million over FY15E to FY17E. If this is boosted by the RM150 million to RM165 million in dividend contribution from YTLP\u2019s associates, it would imply an \u201call-in\u201d free cash flow of around RM550 million to RM730 million.\nThe Edge reported that a total of 3,000mw of coal-fired capacity that is being built by Malakoff and 1MDB may be delayed, putting the national grid in a possible power crunch position around 2016.\nWe opine that YTLP is set to benefit from the delays at Malakoff\u2019s new plant. With YTLP\u2019s current 1,200mw power purchase agreements (PPAs) expiring in September 2015, an extension to the PPAs would be a natural choice for the country to maintain the 2016/17 reserve margin at above 20% to 25%. We think there is a good chance of a PPA extension for YTLP, and hence now factor in a five-year extension to YTLP\u2019s PPAs. Sarawak Cable Bhd\nFair value: RM1.60 HOLD\nAMRESEARCH (Sept 15): We maintain \u201chold\u201d on SCable with an unchanged SOP-based fair value of RM1.60 per share. SCable announced on Sept 12 that it had accepted the conditional offer made by HNG Capital Sdn Bhd for the proposed acquisition of the latter\u2019s 100% stakes in Universal Cable (M) Bhd and Leader Cable Industry Bhd for RM210 million.\nFollowing the acceptance, SCable made a payment of RM2.1 million in earnest deposit to HNG.\nWhile details of the deal have yet to be firmed up, The Edge reported earlier that SCable may issue up to 10% of new shares to fund the acquisitions. It may also borrow RM110 million, with the remaining RM60 million to be offset by debts owed by HNG to the two companies.\nUCMB has three factories in Nilai and one in Johor, while LCIB has one in Kedah. We expect SCable\u2019s market share in Malaysia to grow to 50% with the acquisitions. As the details have not been firmed up, we have not factored in the proposed acquisitions into our model. Uzma Bhd\nTarget price: RM4.40 BUY\nUOB KAY HIAN (Sept 15): Uzma bought MMSVS for US$29.7 million. MMSVS provides services related to the repair and maintenance of exploratory and production wells utilising hydraulic workover units (HWUs). MMSVS has a fleet of seven HWUs and one truck mounted service rig that can work onshore and offshore.\nAll of MMSVS\u2019 assets are currently under operation and have a young average age of less than five years old. We expect MMSVS to generate a net profit of RM3 million to RM4 million in 2014 and RM10 million in 2015/16, assuming the assets are fully mobilised and have a 15% net margin.\nWe advocate investors to remain invested in Uzma as it still offers growth in the short to medium term. Backed by a management team with strong entrepreneurial skills and focused growth in its target market, we believe the company could eventually further expand its regional footprints in Southeast Asia and maximise the synergies from its recently acquired companies. Target price unchanged at RM4.40, pegged to 16 times 2016F PER. Benalec Holdings Bhd\nTarget price: RM1.25 OUTPERFORM\nKENANGA RESEARCH (Sept 15): Benalec announced that it is proposing to issue up to RM200 million nominal value of seven-year redeemable convertible secured bonds (CB). We were not surprised at the news as the CB is mainly to strengthen its cash flow for the smooth execution of its massive reclamation projects in Melaka that was secured in FY14.\nAssuming the CB is fully converted before FY16, with an assumption of a conversion price of RM1.05, our FY16E EPS will be diluted by 20% to 7.2 sen from 8.8 sen currently. This will translate into FY16E PER of 12.9 times from the current implied FY16E PER of 10.5 times.\nOur forecasted FY16 EPS may be accretive if the group inks the land sale deal with 1MY Strategic Oil Terminal for 1,000 acres in Tanjung Piai before FY16. Assuming Benalec inks the deal at a price tag of RM60 psf or a total of RM2.6 billion, and with a 25% net margin, our FY16 net profit estimate may be revised by 92%, exceeding the dilution impact. CB Industrial Product Holding Bhd\nTarget price: RM5.75 BUY\nALLIANCE DBS RESEARCH (Sept 15): CBIP\u2019s current order book remains strong at RM465 million and we think new contract wins could reach RM300 million this year. In the near term, CBIP could benefit from an increase in mature palm oil areas in Malaysia and Indonesia, which is forecast to average 458,000ha per year for 2014 to 2016. This could translate into 5.3 million fresh fruit bunch output, which requires at least 21 processing mills per year.\nWe also anticipate sizeable contracts from its major customers Sime Darby \u2014 from the development of its estates in Liberia \u2014 and FGV, from the possible replacement of its older conventional mills. However, CBIP could face earnings risk of about 11% for FY15/16 from higher effective tax rates. This is from the expiration of its pioneer status for Modipalm by February 2015. But application is in the works for a renewal of the pioneer status for its waste management system.\nWe maintain our \u201cbuy\u201d recommendation with a higher target price of RM5.75. Thong Guan Industries Bhd\nTarget price: RM3 BUY\nCIMB RESEARCH (Sept 15): We maintain our EPS forecasts, but with the ex-date just over for the proposed ICULS (irredeemable convertible unsecured loan stock)/warrants, we revise our target price to ex-all price at RM3, based on a 30% discount to its fully diluted RM4.28 SOP per share. Potential re-rating catalysts include stronger group Ebitda margins and regional M&A developments.\nOver the next few years, TGI will focus less on top-line growth and more on bottom-line growth. It will produce more high value-added products. It is committed to RM100 million capex over the next few years, which should boost group production capacity by 40% to 170,000 tonnes annually in three to four years\u2019 time.\nTGI has been putting more effort into R&D over the past few years, offering high value-added services and products to its customers. The company is setting up a US$2 million R&D centre at its Sungai Petani plant, to be ready by year-end. This will be the first-of-its-kind R&D centre in Asia-Pacific, equipped with sophisticated and advanced equipment from Europe. IHH Healthcare Bhd\nTarget price: RM4.50 HOLD\nPUBLICINVEST RESEARCH (Sept 15): IHH announced on Sept 12 that the group has entered into a sale and purchase agreement with Fortis Healthcare Singapore Pte Ltd to acquire Radlink-Asia Pte Ltd, an investment holding company principally involved in the provision of healthcare services in Singapore. The purchase consideration of S$137 million is subject to further adjustments upon completion of the proposed acquisition.\nDetails are scarce on the proposed acquisition, and the financial performance of Radlink-Asia is not available. Nonetheless, we believe the latter\u2019s profit, if any, would not be significant relative to the group\u2019s bottom line.\nWe are keeping our earnings estimates unchanged pending further information on Radlink-Asia, although we believe earnings contribution from the acquisition will not be significant. Our target price remains unchanged at RM4.50, pegged to FY15 blended EV/Ebitda valuations. The group will continue to see strong revenue growth underpinned by its capacity expansion, especially as more beds are added in 2015, with the newly opened hospitals expected to contribute to the group\u2019s revenue. Hong Leong Bank Bhd\nTarget price: RM15.40 HOLD\nUOB KAY HIAN (Sept 17): Amid intense deposit competition, and hence net interest margin (NIM) compression, and with its below-industry loan-to-deposit ratio of 80%, Hong Leong Bank (HLB) is in a strong position to preserve its NIM better than its peers. This was partially evident in its recent 4QFY14 and FY14 results where it delivered a stronger net interest income growth of 6.3% versus the sector\u2019s 3.4%, while FY14 NIM declined by a smaller 5bps versus peers\u2019 compression of 8bps to 12bps.\nHLB\u2019s current core tier-1 equity ratio of 7.8% at a fully loaded bank level is among the lowest in the industry and poses the greatest risk of an imminent capital raising exercise. We estimate this would entail a RM1.9 billion equity-raising exercise, which could lead to an 11% dilution to its current share base.\nDespite HLB being in a stronger position to defend its NIM and profitability, we are still expecting a relatively muted net profit growth of 5.6% for FY15 versus 13.3% in FY14. MMC Corp Bhd\nTarget price: RM2.81 MARKET PERFORM\nKENANGA RESEARCH (Sept 15): We noticed that MMC is gaining interest recently due to the group\u2019s 2Q14 earnings recovery driven by Malakoff\u2019s Tanjung Bin power plant recovery and KVMRT1 construction progress.\nWith Malakoff\u2019s earnings recovery, we believe the probability of its listing of Malakoff has increased. One of the push factors is that Malakoff\u2019s Junior Sukuk of RM1.8 billion with 6.3% interest rate due by September 2015, if it is not redeemed, will result in higher interest costs.\nMMC\u2019s other key divisions have been gaining momentum, thanks to the KVMRT1 progress and growing port activities in PTP. However, we are maintaining our \u201cmarket perform\u201d call on MMC with a revised target price of RM2.81. We are cautious about the potential delay in the 1,000mw Tanjung Bin extension, which may affect the stock\u2019s sentiment in the near term.\nEven though it may not impact Malakoff\u2019s discounted cash flow valuation, we prefer to remain conservative here as we would prefer that there is more clarity on the issue to avoid impact on investors\u2019 sentiment. \nThis article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on September 22-28, 2014. \u00a0"}, "282": {"date_posted": "14/10/2014", "title": "CPO export tax exemption may be extended", "article": " THE Ministry of Plantation Industries and Commodities (MPIC) is understood to be looking into extending the exemption of export duty on crude palm oil for November and December. Industry sources say the ministry is preparing a paper to justify the extension to be presented to the Cabinet. When contacted, a ministry official says he could neither confirm nor deny that the tax exemption will be extended beyond October.\u00a0 Earlier this month, on Sept 4, Minister Datuk Amar Douglas Uggah Embas announced that effective Sept 1, CPO exporters were exempted from export duty until October. This is part of the government\u2019s efforts to mitigate declining CPO prices by bringing down the stocks of the commodity in the country.\u00a0 Earlier, the CPO export duty for this month had been gazetted at 4.5%, based on the average prices over 30 days in the previous two months. \u201cWe understand that the ministry is preparing a justification for extending the exemption,\u201d says an industry player from the refining sector, adding however that he is unaware what the justification might be. CPO stocks rose to a 17-month high of 2.05 million tonnes in August, rising 23% from the previous month due to higher than expected production of fresh fruit bunches (FFB). In August, FFB production rose 22% to a monthly high of 2.03 million tonnes.\u00a0 The low CPO price and high inventory led to the government\u2019s move to exempt export duty on the commodity for September and October.\u00a0 The minister said the exemption from duties is expected to raise palm oil exports by 600,000 tonnes over the two months and reduce stock levels to 1.6 million tonnes by the end of the year.\u00a0 The tax exemption, if extended, should be positive for CPO prices. Since the announcement by the ministry on Sept 4, prices have improved, with the third month benchmark rebounding from its year-low of RM1,926 on Aug 29 to last Friday\u2019s close of RM2,111 per tonne. \u00a0 \u00a0 However, the exemption is expected to have a negative impact on palm oil refiners, more so the independent ones than the integrated players as they lose their competitiveness to their Indonesian counterparts with more oil leaving the country. Malaysia has more refining capacity than the CPO it produces. Last year, Malaysian oil palm estates produced 19.2 million tonnes of CPO compared to refining capacity of around 26 million tonnes, which works out to a utilisation rate of about 74% if all the oil were refined locally. \u00a0 According to industry sources, local refineries need to achieve a utilisation rate of at least 60% to stay in business as margins dip into the red below this level. On average, up to August this year, Malaysian refineries achieved a utilisation rate of around 64%, those in the industry say.\u00a0 When contacted, integrated plantation player Sime Darby Bhd says its refineries have yet to be negatively impacted by the tax exemption on CPO export for September as stock levels are still high.\u00a0 \u201cIn the next few weeks however, as the CPO stock decreases, it will eventually affect our refineries,\u201d says its spokesperson.\u00a0 Sime Darby has refining capacity of 1.5 million tonnes per year in Malaysia compared with its CPO production of 1.4 million tonnes in its fiscal year to June 2013.\u00a0 \u201cWe rely on third-party suppliers in locations where there is insufficient CPO supply,\u201d the spokesperson says, adding that Sime Darby does not have a tax-free export quota.\u00a0 The government scrapped the tax-free quota in 2013 when it implemented a new tax structure for CPO exports. The situation may not be all bleak for local refiners, however, if Indonesia follows suit by slashing its export tax to zero for October. If international CPO prices fall below US$750 per tonne, the Indonesian export tax will be automatically cut to zero.\u00a0 The CPO price in Indonesia was US$730 last Friday. \u00a0 For September, Indonesia has set the CPO export tax at 9%. The monthly rate is set using both global and local CPO prices on the first 20 days of the previous month. \u201cBased on the current CPO export price, on CIF Rotterdam basis, I won\u2019t be surprised if Indonesia \u00a0announces zero tax for CPO in October. In fact, the industry is already expecting it,\u201d says the industry player.\u00a0 He adds that if Indonesia follows suit in announcing zero CPO export tax in October, it will be a level playing field for Malaysia, which will be positive for local refiners.\u00a0 \u201cIn fact, if Indonesia announces the zero CPO export tax in November and December 2014, it will also be good for our local refiners,\u201d he says. CPO inventory in Indonesia, the world\u2019s largest producer, may have surged to a 15-month high in August due to rising production and reduced demand from importers. Inventories jumped 24% to 2.5 million tonnes from 2.02 million tonnes in July, according to a survey by Bloomberg.\u00a0 This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on September 22-28, 2014."}, "283": {"date_posted": "14/10/2014", "title": "Hitting its sweet spot this year", "article": " IFCA MSC Bhd\n(Oct 13, RM0.485)\nInitiating coverage with an \u201cadd\u201d call and target price of 78 sen: IFCA is an enterprise software solutions provider focused particularly on property development, golf clubs, hotels and the construction sector.

Most of the major domestic property developers, such as Sime Darby, S P Setia, EcoWorld and Mah Sing, are\nIFCA\u2019s customers.

The IPO will most likely involve its automobile division, he added. It was previously reported that the potential IPO was estimated to raise some US$500 million (RM1.62 billion). Mohd Bakke said the group is looking to fund the buy with external borrowings (80%) and internally-generated funds (20%). The raising of funds via the IPO will help \u201cmanage\u201d the group\u2019s gearing level. \u201cOur gearing ratio is 38% as at June this year. With this acquisition, at least by the end of next [calendar] year, our gearing will probably move up to 55%. By then, we hope to be able to raise cash from our IPO and, at the same time, rationalise our capital expenditure \u2026 With these, our gearing should come down to 40%,\u201d he noted. He was speaking to reporters at the group\u2019s media briefing yesterday on the general offer (GO) by its plantation arm \u2014 Sime Darby Plantation Sdn Bhd \u2014 to buy 100% of NPBOL shares at \u00a37.15 (RM37.50) per share or \u00a31.07 billion in total. The offer is conditional upon Sime Darby obtaining a minimum 51% acceptance of NBPOL shares. As at\u00a0June 30, Sime Darby\u2019s total borrowings stood at RM11.17 billion against total equity of RM29.44 billion. Minus its cash balance of RM4.9 billion, it has a net gearing of about 21 times. However, Sime Darby may not have to fork out the entire RM5.6 billion. It may just get up to 70% of NBPOL. \u201cI think they (the Papua New Guinea [PNG] government) will increase [their stake]. My \u2018hunch\u2019 tells me that they are looking at around 30%.\u00a0That\u2019s a good move because a partnership with the government bodes well for the business,\u201d Mohd Bakke said. As at June 30, Kulim Bhd owns 49% of NBPOL, the PNG government and other interests hold 22%, and institutional and retail investors have 24%, while the NBPOL management has the remaining 5%. Sime Darby\u2019s offer price represents a 30% premium to Kulim Bhd\u2019s failed bid of \u00a35.50 per share for 20% of NBPOL last year, as its independent board viewed the fair value of the company at between \u00a36.50 and \u00a37.00 per share. Sime Darby deems its offer price, which is at an 85% premium to NBPOL\u2019s last closing price on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) on Wednesday and a 55.7% premium to the volume weighted average closing price over the last 60 days, as fair. \u201cIt may appear high but due to the illiquid nature of NBPOL\u2019s shares on the LSE and the PNG Port Moresby Stock Exchange \u2014 with average trading volume representing less than 0.5% of the public float \u2014 the current price is not necessarily reflective of the company\u2019s value,\u201d said Mohd Bakke. The offer price, which stood at the higher end of analysts\u2019 estimates, values NBPOL at about RM84,000 on an enterprise value per ha. Decreasing crude palm oil and palm kernel oil prices have dragged down NBPOL\u2019s performance recently, with profit before tax dropping from US$275.5 million in financial year 2011 (FY11) to US$17.3 million in FY13. Nonetheless, Mohd Bakke said, the buy, which should be completed by year-end, should gain Sime Darby earnings per share accretion of 4% to 5% in the next two years. Sime Darby plans to delist NBPOL from the LSE and relist it on either Bursa Malaysia or the Singapore Exchange in the future. \u201cWe intend to acquire both board and management control,\u201d said Mohd Bakke.

In a statement, Sime Darby said it had decided at this time not to proceed further in relation to the proposal following the expiry of the exclusivity period but no details were given.

At a premium of between 30% and 50% over the current price of \u00a35.40 to \u00a36.30 per share, NBPOL would be valued at 21 times and 24 times its FY14 EPS \u2014 which is on the steep side. This would have translated into a purchase price of between RM4.3 billion and RM5 billion for Sime Darby to assume full control of NBPOL.

Sime Darby\u2019s plantation growth prospects still rest significantly on its Liberian operations, which have come to a halt due to the Ebola outbreak.

E&O had announced in early July that Sime Darby Bhd \u2014 which is its single largest shareholder with a 22% stake \u2014 is in talks to sell to the company 135 acres of land in Elmina West for RM239.8 million. The 135 acres is part of a 5,000-acre land, earmarked for the City of Elmina commercial and residential township project.

Even with the reduced gain, E&O was the fourth biggest gainer on Bursa Malaysia\u2019s. In a note to client Thursday, AmResearch reaffirmed its rating on the counter with an unchanged fair value (FV) of RM4.00 per share, based on a 15% discount to net asset value (NAV) of RM4.73 per share. \"Our NAV model is based on a conservative assumed land value of RM250psf for Sri Tanjung Pinang 2 (STP2) (project in Penang), and has yet to capture any development profits from STP2,\" said AmResearch analyst Tan Ee Zhio. \"We are unmoved by the share price retracement from its peak of RM3.18/share in July. Our conversations with management revealed that its fundamentals remain intact and the progress of STP2 is coming along nicely,\" Tan said. Tan noted that E&O is in the midst of finalising the tender documents for reclamation of STP2, and the calling of tender is expected to take place by November. \"We also acknowledged that E&O will call for an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on Sept 19, for shareholders to decide on the proposed acquisition of 135 acres of land at Elmina West, for RM239 million from Sime Darby,\" he added. To recap, E&O\u2019s entry cost for Elmina West is RM41psf (including conversion premium), comprising land cost of RM33psf and infrastructure cost of RM8psf. Tan said: \"This is viewed as fair, given that land prices within the vicinity are transacted at above RM100psf (Kwasa Land\u2019s reserve price is RM300psf).\" It is understood that E&O will undertake a wellness-themed mixed development at Elmina West, in five staggered phases over a seven-year period. Tan pointed out that E&O is trading at a steep discount of 42% vis-a-vis its NAV. \"We believe this is unjustified, given more NAV upside from STP2 and its increasing presence within the Klang Valley,\" he said. According to AmResearch's projection, E&O's revenue and net profit for the year ending March 31, 2015, will be RM683.7 million and RM144.8 million respectively.

This is only 94% and 90% of our and consensus estimates. The major variation was the higher prize payout, although we understand the group made (undisclosed) charitable donations in the quarter. Gaming revenue per outlet per draw fell 3.2% y-o-y. BToto has proposed a fourth interim dividend of seven sen per share, taking total dividend payout for FY14 to 26.5 sen. This implies a 106% payout ratio based on core earnings. However, 9.5 sen was distributed in the form of 30.6 million treasury shares. BToto is left with only 2.9 million treasury shares, so we believe the generous payout is unlikely to recur. The stock lacks near-term re-rating catalysts and there are downside risks to earnings. These include the possible non-renewal of Berjaya Philippines\u2019 gaming concession, which expires in August 2015, and the implementation of goods and services tax on NFO operations. IJM Plantations Bhd\nTarget price: RM3.81 HOLD\nHONG LEONG INVESTMENT BANK (June 17): We expect Indonesia to remain the main driver for IJMP\u2019s overall fresh fruit bunch (FFB) output growth, underpinned by more planted areas reaching maturity (5,000ha to 8,000ha a year over the next three years). We projected overall FFB production to grow 10% to 13% in FY03/15-17 (versus 9.3% to 10% previously), underpinned by a 26% to 43% increase in FFB production in Indonesia over the next three years. We are raising our FY03/15-16 net profit forecasts by 5.3% and 12% respectively, largely to account for higher FFB yield and lower production cost assumptions for its Indonesian operations. Based on our sensitivity analysis, every RM100 per tonne increase in our average CPO price assumption will raise our FY03/15-17 net profit forecasts by 8.3% to 8.6%. We raise our target price on the stock by 12.1% to RM3.81, based on unchanged 17 times revised FY03/16 EPS of 22.4 sen.

Westports Holdings Bhd\nTarget price: RM2.85 BUY\nMAYBANK IB RESEARCH (June 18): China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce blocked the formation of the P3 alliance on June 17 as it thinks the proposed vessel-pooling accord will restrict competition on the busiest Asia-Europe routes. The P3 members (Maersk, MSC and CMA CGM) have announced that the P3 plan will now be scrapped. Despite its solid earnings delivery and strong non-P3 volume growth, Westports\u2019 share price performance has been lacklustre since its listing in October 2013 because of concerns about P3. Given the latest development, we believe Westports will see an overdue re-rating. it trades at an implied forward PER of 18 times, below its regional peers\u2019 average of 22 times. We are reversing the potential impact and raising our full-year container volume growth to 10% and 9% for FY14 and FY15 respectively. Consequently, our FY14-FY16 EPS forecasts are raised by 2%, 4% and 4% respectively and our discounted cash flow-derived target price is nudged up to RM2.85, indicating a forward PER of 19 times. Top Glove Corp Bhd\nTarget price: RM4.48 HOLD\nCIMB RESEARCH (June 17): Top Glove\u2019s 9MFY14 net profit came in below expectations, at 69.2% and 66% of our and consensus full-year forecasts respectively. Meanwhile, 9MFY14 revenue dropped 3.9% y-o-y owing to lower selling prices while core net profit declined 4.6% because of the poorer performance from China and the higher effective tax rate. Thus, we are reducing our FY14-FY16 net profit forecasts by 5% to 8%, trimming our target price, still based on 14.5 times PER (about 20% discount to Hartalega). We maintain a \u201chold\u201d on Top Glove but prefer Kossan. Top Glove declared its first dividend for FY14, a single-tier dividend per share of 7 sen, in line with our forecast. We think that Top Glove has been able to contain its operating costs quite well through aggressive cost-optimisation initiatives. This can be seen from the stronger Ebitda margin, although it was impacted by the large foreign exchange loss in 9MFY14. The higher Ebitda margin was also driven by higher sales contribution from nitrile. SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd\nTarget price: RM5.59 BUY\nMIDF RESEARCH (June 17): SAKP announced three new contracts and a contract extension for its tender assist drilling rigs. The jobs are from Petronas Carigali, Chevron Thailand and BP Trinidad & Tobago. The contracts are worth a collective US$700 million or approximately RM2.3 billion. Petronas Carigali awarded SAKP with two new contracts for its tender assist drilling rigs \u2014 the SKD T-9 and SKD T-10. Both rigs will be used for Petronas Carigali\u2019s drilling campaigns offshore Malaysia. Another new contract for its tender assist drilling rig, the SKD T-18, was awarded by Chevron Thailand for its drilling campaign in Thailand. We remain bullish on SAKP and reiterate our \u201cbuy\u201d recommendation with an unchanged target price. Our target price is premised on PER 2016 of 23 times and EPS 2016 of 24.3 sen. We are bullish on SAKP for its strong quality and well-diversified orderbook, healthy earnings and consistent job wins. Our target PER is relatively conservative, and is based on the lowest average monthly forward PER over the past year.

The results were a tad higher than our full-year projection and the consensus estimates by 29% and 14% respectively, deviated by stronger-than-expected earnings contribution from its associate Mazda Malaysia Sdn Bhd, and higher-than-expected margins owing to favourable MYR/JPY rates and better sales mix. \u00a0 Post-results, our FY15 earnings forecast has been revised upwards by 30% to account for higher revenue, underpinned by stronger sales assumption following the group\u2019s attractive new model pipelines and sustainable EBIT margin of 11.2% on the back of the favourable exchange rate and lower import duties. We have nudged up our target price after we rolled over to FY15 with a higher targeted PER of 13 times to align with its industry peers\u2019 valuation. Can-One Bhd\nFair value: RM3.43 TRADING BUY\nPUBLIC INVESTMENT BANK (June 16): Can-One is not waiting around to see whether the sale of Kian Joo\u2019s assets and liabilities to Aspire Insight is completed successfully or not, as it made a move late last week to solidify its earnings prospects going forward. With 80% in hand, the group announced an acquisition of the remaining 20% in F&B Nutrition Sdn Bhd (F&B) for RM112.9 million via the issuance of 39.753 million shares at RM2.84 apiece. The price tag implies a valuation of about 15 times for the entire business. We are making a \u201ctrading buy\u201d call on the stock. Full value to all holdings. Its collective stakes in Kian Joo Can and F&B are worth RM1.05 billion. Setting off the group\u2019s huge borrowings of RM388.2 million (as at March 31, 2014) against that amount leaves us with a residual of RM658.5 million, valuing Can-One at RM3.43 per share on the enlarged share base. If the Aspire Insight deal collapses and Kian Joo reverts to RM2.80 per share, Can-One is still worth about RM2.75. Sime Darby Bhd\nTarget price: RM10.40 NEUTRAL\nRHB RESEARCH (June 17): Sime Darby has entered into a sale and purchase agreement (S&P) with B. Grimm Power Ltd for the disposal of a 100% stake in Sime Darby Power Co Ltd (SDPC), Sime Darby LCP Power Co Ltd (SDLP), and Sime Darby O&M (Thailand) Co Ltd (SOMT), for a total cash consideration of US$162.9 million (RM522.9 million). The disposals are expected to be completed this month. The disposals do not come as a surprise, as Sime Darby sold off its Malaysian power plant in April for RM300 million in a bid to dispose of its non-core assets. We maintain our sum-of-parts (SOP)-based fair value of RM10.40 and our \u201cneutral\u201d recommendation. Although we are still positive on the plantation sector as a whole, the weaknesses at Sime Darby\u2019s heavy equipment and motor division could be a threat to earnings growth, despite its sensitivity to crude palm oil (CPO) prices. Hence, we advocate shifting away from the more integrated players to the purer planters, which would benefit more significantly from CPO price movements. Sarawak Cable Bhd\nFair value: RM1.70 HOLD \nAMRESEARCH (June 17): We place our \u201cfair value\u201d rating for SCable under review, pending further details on the proposed acquisitions that were announced yesterday. SCable has accepted a conditional offer from HNG Capital Sdn Bhd for the former to purchase 100% equity interests in Universal Cable (M) Bhd and Leader Cable Industry Bhd for RM210 million. The offer will fortify SCable as the leading cable manufacturer in the country with an estimated market share of more than 50%. We understand that following the acquisition, SCable will essentially supply all the cables for the 500kV job on a consolidated basis. The acquiree companies are two of the top suppliers in Peninsular Malaysia. Margins are likely to be similar with that of SCable\u2019s existing power cable business. Note that non-independent and non-executive director Datuk Seri H\u2019ng Bok San is the controlling shareholder of HNG. If accepted, we expect the share sale agreement to be finalised within 3Q before SCable seeks shareholders\u2019 approval in an extraordinary general meeting. Hong Leong Industries Bhd \nTarget price: RM6.86 TRADING BUY\nUOB KAY HIAN (June 16): HLI and Narra will seek shareholders\u2019 approval for a series of restructuring exercises, which will see a backdoor listing of HLI\u2019s infrastructure business into Narra. We see a \u201ctrading buy\u201d opportunity as there could be significant upside to our sum-of-parts (SOP) valuation should Narra\u2019s current implied valuation hold up. The implied post-exercise value of Narra at RM4.49 per HLI share is well above our RM2.30 for HLI. Narra\u2019s implied post-exercise market cap is RM2 billion, implying a share price of RM4.16. While we doubt Narra\u2019s present lofty valuation can sustain after the exercise, we acknowledge that it could fetch a valuation that is significantly above our appraised valuation. Should Narra\u2019s valuation hold up after the restructuring, our adjusted SOP valuation and target price for HLI would be RM10.39 and RM9.26 respectively. This compares with our target price of RM6.86, which assumes Narra shares at RM2.30 per HLI share and a 20% holding company discount to our SOP valuation of RM5.70 for HLI\u2019s remaining assets. Alliance Financial Group Bhd \nTarget price: RM5.40 BUY\nAFFIN INVESTMENT BANK (June 17): We are of the view that AFG\u2019s stock price decline is overdone since news of Alliance Bank Malaysia group CEO\u2019s resignation was made public on June 5. The banking group is backed by a solid management team and has a proven track record in the delivery of results and its relationship management. Management is striving to achieve key performance indicators for FY15 by replicating FY14\u2019s loan growth of 14.1% y-o-y in FY15E, and achieving a higher return on equity of above 14% in FY15E. With the share price correction, which has provided investors an upside of 15% to our target price of RM5.40, we revise our rating from \u201cadd\u201d to \u201cbuy\u201d. We continue to like the stock, given the attractive dividends, with a net yield of 4.8% to 5.8% in FY15-FY17, subsequent to a slight increase in the payout ratio from 50% to 60% (which was announced during the last results quarter). Management is more proactive and will continue to focus on achieving near-term strategic priorities, such as a 30% non-interest income ratio. Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd\nTarget price: RM10.55 BUY\nHONG LEONG INVESTMENT BANK (June 16): MAHB released weak statistics for May, showing passenger movement growth of only 2.1% y-o-y, owing to the impact of the MH370 crisis and kidnappings in Sabah, capacity rationalisation (especially on domestic routes) and high base effect (strong traffic during the election in May 2013). Nevertheless, year-to-date passenger growth remained strong at 13.5% y-o-y versus HLIB\u2019s forecasted +12.8% y-o-y for FY14. KLIA experienced a decrease of -11% on China sector routes alone (about 10% of the overall passenger movement) after the MH370 and kidnapping of Chinese incidents. We believe MAS as the main airline operator in KLIA\u2019s main terminal building (-3.2% y-o-y in May) severely affected MAHB. Since mid-May, local airlines \u2014 MAS, AirAsia Group (including AirAsia X) and Malindo \u2014 have been aggressive in their marketing campaigns to fill up increasing flight capacity. Hence, we expect a recovery in June-July (impact normalisation) and MAHB remains the major beneficiary.

Kuala Lumpur's composite index ended up 0.2 percent, with shares of Sime Darby at their highest since June 05. Jakarta's composite index rose 0.5 percent, ending three days of losses, with shares of Astra Agro Lestari among gainers. Malaysian palm oil futures stretched gains into a fourth session, lifted by firm crude oil prices and concerns that the onset of dry weather could curb palm yields. Bangkok's SET index finished a tad lower, weighed by losses in shares of top mobile phone operator, Advanced Info Service, and no.2 operator, Total Access Communication. Thailand's telecommunications regulator said that it has suspended temporarily, an auction of 4G mobile licences, as more time is needed to work out the details of the process, as well as to ensure transparency. The Philippine main index fell for a third session, ending down 0.8 percent at its lowest level since May 30, as large caps, including Ayala Land and Philippine Long Distance Telephone, fell amid foreign outflows. The Philippine bourse said that foreign investors sold shares worth a net 314.6 million pesos ($7.17 million).

Our earlier checks with other developers indicated that they were less likely to bid for the project as most of them already had enough projects in hand at the moment. However, we believe that the strongest contender would still be Malaysian Resources Corp (MRCB), given its expertise in developing central transport hubs and the common major shareholder for both Kwasa Land Sdn Bhd and MRCB is the Employees Provident Fund. Assuming that MRCB wins this first development project on a 64.1-acre parcel, we estimate that it could potentially boost the company\u2019s RNAV by 30 sen per share. While valuations are within fair value range, we foresee a protracted consolidation period for the sector as: a) property prices are peakish; b) the property market requires a digestion period as supply rushes in; and c) the tightening regulatory cycle has been slowing secondary sales. CB Industrial Product Holding BhdFair value: RM4.95 NEUTRAL RHB RESEARCH (June 02): CB Industrial Product\u2019s (CBIP) 1QFY14 core net profit was in line with our and consensus estimates, coming in at 23% to 24% of FY14 forecasts. No dividend was declared for this quarter. Core net profit rose 24.7% y-o-y, but revenue contracted 18.4%. The decline in top line was mainly due to a 57.7% drop in revenue from the vehicle retrofitting division because of lower project completion during the period. However, this was offset by a 22.6% rise in earnings from the oil mill engineering division due to higher project billings. Despite the in-line earnings, we are revising our FY14-15 forecasts downwards by 4% to 5% after taking into account the higher losses at its plantation division in Indonesia, which were due to start-up costs. Post-earnings revision and after rolling over our valuation base to 2015, our SOP-based fair value drops slightly to RM4.95 from RM5. Our valuation targets are unchanged, at nine times PER for its associate plantation business and 13 times PER for its oil mill engineering and vehicle retrofitting division.  Mah Sing Group BhdTarget price: RM2.47 HOLD HONG LEONG INVESTMENT BANK (June 04): Mah Sing announced an increase in gross development value (GDV) for Southville [email\u00a0protected] South, from the preliminary RM5.13 billion to RM8.3 billion. The developer attributed this to the recently approved township master plan. The key difference is the commercial component \u2014 previously, the project was to comprise low-rise shopoffices, but will now feature high-rise commercial blocks consisting of office towers, SoHos, serviced apartments, a shopping centre and possibly hotels. The commercial zone will occupy 60.21 acres fronting the North-South Expressway.  The take-up for its latest phase in Southville was also encouraging, at 80% for the Avens Residence released last weekend. Southville has been a success for the group, having generated RM600 million sales to date. We still believe it is premature to turn \u201caggressive\u201d on property developers at this point in time, given the uncertain outlook arising from macro and sector headwinds.  Tenaga Nasional BhdTarget price: RM12.32 NEUTRAL PUBLIC INVESTMENT BANK (June 02): It was reported that the Energy Commission (EC) has awarded Project 4A via direct negotiation to a consortium comprising Tenaga Nasional, YTL Power International Bhd and SIPP Energy Sdn Bhd. The proposed combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant, to be built in Pasir Gudang, Johor, will have a capacity of 1,000mw to 1,400mw. Being a fast-track project, the plant\u2019s commercial operation date has been brought forward to 2018, as opposed to the original 2020 target, according to the EC\u2019s plant-up schedule.  We estimate the project will cost RM2.5 billion to RM3.5 billion, based on the cost of the Prai CCGT power plant, which Tenaga won in 2012. While the tariff has not been disclosed, the EC has stated that the award was conditional upon a comparable levelised tariff, with the Prai plant\u2019s winning bid of 34.7 sen per kWh as reference. Nonetheless, we believe earnings contribution to Tenaga, while positive, will not be significant.  Kian Joo Can Factory BhdTarget price: RM3.83 BUY TA SECURITIES (June 02): Kian Joo Can Factory\u2019s 1QFY14 net profit dropped 34.8% y-o-y to RM19.8 million. It came below our and the street\u2019s estimates, making up 13% and 14% of full-year forecasts respectively. On the takeover, since the company\u2019s directors have agreed to accept Aspire Insight Sdn Bhd\u2019s offer of RM3.30 per share, there has not been any letter or circular issued by the independent adviser to date. Furthermore, Bursa Malaysia has given management more time to submit the draft circular to shareholders.  Although we are surprised by the company\u2019s dismal performance in 1QFY14, it may be a premature reflection of its full-year earnings because of high plant start-up cost for its carton business and delay in passing higher raw material costs to customers. We roll forward our earnings to FY15 EPS of 33.3 sen, but maintain our PER of 11.5 times as we believe the company deserves a premium for its sound fundamental as highlighted many times previously.  Kimlun Corp BhdTarget price: RM1.60 UNDERPERFORM KENANGA RESEARCH (June 02): Kimlun Corp\u2019s 1QFY14 core net profit of RM8.7 million is below expectations, accounting for 18.4% of our full-year forecast and 17.8% of consensus estimates. Note that we have excluded the after-tax disposal gain of RM10.77 million from the Nilai land from our core earnings figures. Y-o-y, Kimlun\u2019s 1QFY14 core net profit dropped 3.3% despite a 34.6% increase in core revenue. This was mainly due to higher effective tax rate (+0.9 percentage point), selling and administrative expenses (+27.7% y-o-y) and finance costs (+43.1% y-o-y). The group\u2019s gross profit margin improved by 1.6ppts due to a higher contribution from the property development division, which was more than enough to compensate for the lower margins from the construction and manufacturing divisions. Kimlun\u2019s current outstanding order book of RM2.1 billion will provide earnings visibility for the next two years. The property development division\u2019s contribution should pick up in FY14-15E, thanks to its unbilled sales of RM131 million.  Berjaya Auto BhdTarget price: RM2.90 BUY MAYBANK IB RESEARCH (June 04): Berjaya Auto\u2019s (BAuto) 4QFY14 results are likely to beat consensus expectations. We expect the company to report a net profit of RM45 million to RM50 million (+52% to 69% q-o-q) in the quarter, with a higher gross profit margin (+1.5ppts to 17%), driven by a better sales mix and cost-savings from higher localisation and weaker ringgit-yen exchange rate. Mazda\u2019s FY14 vehicle sales met our expectations, coming in at 9,500 units for Malaysia and 2,300 units for the Philippines.  We raise FY14/15/16 core net earnings by 23%/20%/20% after increasing our gross profit margin assumption to 17% (+1.5ppts), taking into account: (i) a more favourable exchange rate (from RM3.22/\u00a5100 to RM3.17/\u00a5100); (ii) higher localisation of content; and (iii) improved product mix. We continue to like BAuto for its strong earnings growth prospects (61% three-year net earnings CAGR). Growth will largely be driven by its strong new launches and superior cost control by the management. \u00a0 Protasco BhdTarget price: RM2.90 BUY MIDF RESEARCH (June 03): HCM Engineering Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Protasco Bhd, has secured federal road jobs in Zone 2A in Sarawak, worth RM21 million. The contract was awarded by the Public Works Department for the construction of overtaking lanes from Sibu to Bintulu and from Bintulu to Tatau. Assuming a margin of 14% with a completion period of 12 months, we expect this project to contribute about RM1.3 million and RM1.6 million to the group\u2019s FY14 and FY15 operating profits respectively.  We continue to like the company due to: (i) its healthy construction outstanding order book of RM700 million; (ii) the potential road construction jobs to be secured; (iii) its recurring maintenance concession earnings; (iv) its integrated flagship property developments on 100 acres in Bangi, Selangor, and 14.4 acres in Pasir Gudang Johor; and (v) its profit guarantee from the oil and gas business. Star Publications (M) BhdTarget price: RM2.55 HOLD ALLIANCE DBS RESEARCH (June 03): Star Publications\u2019 e-paper subscriptions now stand at 80,000, up from 50,000 in 2H2013. This was helped by incentives given to vendors to promote the e-paper bundle to its 100,000 physical paper subscribers. Star is getting sponsorship from CIMB Group for the Asean ePaper (a collaboration between the company and three other English dailies in the region). The collaboration is done on a revenue-sharing basis, with 60% of the earnings going to the party that secures the sponsorship.  We think Star intends to leverage its wide English content as a source of growth beyond its print business. This has been demonstrated by its recent collaboration with Bloomberg TV Malaysia to provide business content. Star is expected to scale down its Sarawak operations by 3QFY14 as it is loss-making and the circulation figures are not meaningful. Contrary to previous guidance, the company is reviewing its voluntary separation scheme and does not plan to reduce its staff strength further for now. \u00a0 Dialog Group BhdTarget price: RM4.16 ADD CIMB RESEARCH (June 01): Dialog has accepted a letter of intent from Australia\u2019s Roc Oil Co Ltd for the farming out of 20% of Roc\u2019s participating interest in a production sharing contract (PSC)\u00a0 for three fields located off Sarawak. This will reduce Roc\u2019s participating interest in the PSC to 30%. The remaining 50% of the PSC is held by Petronas. We understand that the fields are already in production. We view the surprise development favourably as it is a natural progression from Dialog\u2019s participation in the risk sharing contract to develop the Balai marginal field cluster in a 32:48:20 joint venture between Dialog, Roc and Petronas.  All of Dialog\u2019s upstream works are located in Sarawak waters. In addition to D35, D21, J4 and Balai, Dialog is working on the Bayan enhanced oil recovery project, offshore Sarawak, in a 50:50 JV with US-based Halliburton. Dialog is by far the biggest winner of oil and gas investments under the government\u2019s Economic Transformation Programme through its involvement in both upstream and downstream projects. Panasonic Manufacturing Malaysia BhdTarget price: RM24.43 BUY MIDF RESEARCH (June 02): Panasonic posted 4QFY14 earnings of RM18.7 million, which was within our and market expectations, accounting for 22% of both our and consensus full-year forecasts. The company achieved a new revenue record of RM899.2 million for FY14, an increase of 4% y-o-y, mainly due to an increase in sales of fans in the domestic and foreign markets. Earnings for the quarter grew 32% y-o-y to RM18.7 million because of increased sales of its home appliances. Its FY14 earnings rose 7.6% y-o-y to RM80.8 million due to higher festive season sales in the third quarter. Moreover, its FY14 net margin increased 0.3ppt y-o-y.  Our target price of RM24.43 per share is based on a PER multiple of 16 times the group\u2019s forecast FY15 EPS. The assigned multiple is derived from Panasonic\u2019s five-year historical PER. Although the potential 12-month total return is slightly less than the 15% threshold required for our \u201cbuy\u201d recommendation, we are making an exception for Panasonic due to its dividend appeal. Sime Darby BhdTarget price: RM9.20 NEUTRAL JP MORGAN (May 29): Sime Darby reported 3QFY14 net profit of RM882 million (up 24% y-o-y), taking 9MFY14 net profit to RM2.2 billion (down 9% y-o-y), which was only 66% to 67% of our and consensus full-year estimates. Performance was weak across all segments, primarily plantation and industrial, which continued to see a decline in production and lower equipment sales respectively. While some degree of q-o-q production recovery may be expected in the plantation division going into 4QFY14 due to better weather, we do not think it as a sufficient catalyst for a higher stock price. We stay \u201cneutral\u201d as the stock could remain supported by the expectation of a potential restructuring of its property business, which may result in an eventual spin-off, although we believe this may not be imminent. The key downside risks to our price target include a further decline in CPO prices, cost overruns in Liberia oil palm operations and the economic slowdown leading to a diminished demand for heavy equipment and cars.

The pricing of the shares at RM2.30 each, which was a huge 59% premium to the E&O share price at that time, had raised eyebrows The share sales had sparked debate whether it was tantamount to a related party transaction and whether Sime Darby should undertake a mandatory general offer for E&O.

The most-active stock was Olympia Industries Bhd. Despite the index's rebound, analysts expect the KLCI to exhibit a downward bias.  Earlier today, TA Securities Holdings Bhd wrote in a note that the trend came amid a lack of catalyst to spur the domestic stock market higher in the immediate term. \"The FBM KLCI sustained downward correction for a fifth-straight session on Monday, dragged down by falls in key plantation stocks like IOI Corp, Sime Darby, and PPB Group on weak CPO (crude palm oil) price outlook while lower liners extended low-volume consolidation. \"Further downward bias amid weak-trading momentum is likely to persists given the absence of upside catalyst for the local market in the immediate term,\" TA said.

The revenue growth was largely attributed to: 1) higher loading volume from its LED division; 2) higher production volume for its crystal timing device for major client Epson; and 3) higher contribution from its sensor business. Ebitda margins were stronger at 31.7% versus 29.2% in 1Q13 due to better economies of scale and effective cost management. Headline 1Q14 net profit was up 38.3% to RM14.1 million, mainly due to higher revenue, better margins and lower depreciation charges. The company also declared a total dividend of seven sen per share versus five sen per share in 1Q13.  We believe Globetronics is on track to achieve our 33% EPS growth forecast for FY14. It has indicated that it intends to increase the contribution from its sensor business to between 45% and 50% of group revenue by FY15. We do not rule out the possibility of an earnings upgrade if the other sensor products that Globetronics is currently exploring were to materialise. Alam Maritim Resources BhdTarget price: RM1.96 BUY RHB RESEARCH (April 28): Alam Maritim announced that it had entered into a subscription agreement with Associated Land Sdn Bhd and Caprice Capital International Ltd in relation to the issuance and allotment of 123 million new shares to the two companies. The new shares, representing 15.35% of Alam Maritim\u2019s existing issued and paid-up share capital, will raise RM166 million. Of the amount raised, 40.5% (RM67.2 million) will be used to finance the acquisition of a new vessel, which we believe would be a diving support vessel (DSV) worth about US$80 million (RM259.8 million). The company is bidding for Petronas\u2019 inspection, repair and maintenance contracts worth RM2 billion in total that would require the use of a DSV to perform subsea works. About 57.3% (RM95.1 million) of the proceeds will be used to repay bank borrowings, while the rest would be used to cover miscellaneous expenses. We view the transaction favourably as we expect it to cut Alam\u2019s gross gearing to 0.67 times from 1.07 times. Westports Holdings BhdTarget price: RM2.70 BUY MAYBANK IB RESEARCH (April 29): Westports\u2019 1Q14 container volume grew 12% y-o-y. The strong volume came from its existing customers along fast-growing routes, such as intra-Asia, Asia-Africa and Asia-Australasia. We expect the strong volume to sustain into 2Q14, potentially registering another robust y-o-y growth rate. This is also partially due to the slower volume in 2Q13 from the holdback of import-export activities in view of the 13th general election. The construction of CT7 (Phase 1) is complete and two quay cranes are expected to be installed by May, indicating new annual capacity of 420,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs). Five new quay cranes will be installed by end-2014, raising total new capacity this year by 1.5 million TEUs. In view of the high utilisation port rate of 81% and our expectation of stronger volume ahead, the new capacity is timely. Assuming Westports\u2019 volume stays at the current level, we estimate that its port utilisation will be at 70% (which is still ideal) upon the full commencement of CT7 by end-2014.Malaysia Airports Holdings BhdTarget price: RM9.80 BUY ALLIANCE RESEARCH (April 28): The soon-to-be-opened klia2 can accommodate up to 45 million passengers per annum, a marked increase from the 15 million passenger capacity of the current low-cost-carrier terminal. With the higher capacity as well as improved amenities and connectivity of klia2, we expect the new airport to support the long-term expansion plan of domestic low-cost carriers, thereby cementing Malaysia\u2019s position as the largest low-cost carrier hub in the region.  We also view klia2 as catalytic for MAHB\u2019s KLIA Aeropolis development. Being the first commercial project within KLIA Aeropolis, [email\u00a0protected], if successful, will draw international developers and investors\u2019 interest to the proposed development.  MAHB\u2019s current share price effectively ignores the valuation of its KLIA Aeropolis landbank, which is set to see aggressive developments being rolled out over the next six to seven years. We believe investors should overlook its near-term earnings dilution and accumulate MAHB on any share price weakness. Malaysian Pacific Industries BhdTarget price: RM5 ADD CIMB RESEARCH (April 29): MPI\u2019s 9MFY14 earnings were above our expectations, accounting for 78% of our full-year estimates. The company posted core 9MFY14 net profit of RM42.7 million compared with a net loss of RM3.1 million in 9MFY13. Despite the seasonal weaker demand in the first calendar quarter, 3QFY14 sales expanded by 12.8% y-o-y, driven by a better product mix. The stronger earnings performance is due to better sales of higher-margin packages and a weaker ringgit. Following the stronger result, we raised FY14 to FY16 profit forecast by 3% to 7%. MPI declared a 10 sen tax-exempt dividend for the quarter, which is above our expectations. We expect a better 4QFY14, driven by a pickup in industry demand. We see the stronger earnings contribution from the smartphone and tablet segment as the key re-rating catalyst for the stock. We raise our target price to RM5. MPI is our top pick for the domestic semiconductor sector. Sime Darby BhdTarget price: RM10 OUTPERFORM KENANGA RESEARCH (April 29): Sime Darby announced it was taking a stake in Verdezyne Inc, a US-based biotechnology company. Verdezyne has proprietary technology to produce chemicals derived from sustainable materials, which can be found in the oil palm value chain. Currently, these chemicals are derived from petroleum-based feedstocks. We are neutral on the news, as we believe the near-term impact to earnings is minimal. Assuming a scenario of 80% utilisation for the 13,000 metric ton (MT) commercial plant, production should only result in 10,400 MT of downstream product for Sime and this is small, at 0.4% of its 2.47 million MT of crude palm oil production in FY13. However, the longer-term impact is positive, as it should result in more demand for palm oil, resulting from Verdezyne\u2019s research. Sime\u2019s key earnings driver will still be CPO prices, which we are bullish on. We expect an average CPO price of RM2,800 per MT in CY14. We believe Sime\u2019s 2H14 earning is likely to be higher than 1H14 due to the high CPO prices currently. Hock Seng Lee BhdTarget price: RM2.30 BUY MAYBANK INVESTMENT RESEARCH (April 30): HSL won infrastructure works at Samalaju Industrial Park in Bintulu from Samado Sdn Bhd worth RM73.7 million. The contract consists of piling, drainage, pavement, sewerage station system and related mechanical and electrical works. The job is expected to be completed by 1Q16. We estimate that this contract has lifted HSL\u2019s outstanding construction order book by 6% to RM1.27 billion. We forecast a net profit contribution of RM13.3 million into FY16, assuming net profit margin of 18%, which translates into an EPS of 2.2 sen to be recognised in the next three years. HSL will continue to ride on the development in SCORE, particularly the reclamation and infrastructure works. HSL consortium is also vying for Package 2 of the Kuching Centralised Wastewater Management System. Ex-cash and the book value of its property development land of 62 sen per share, HSL is trading at an undemanding valuation of just 6.9 times 12-month forward earnings. Yinson Holdings BhdTarget price: RM10.33 BUY AMRESEARCH (April 29): Yinson has fixed its proposed rights issue price at RM2.20 per share on a one-for-one entitlement basis, slightly lower than our earlier expectation of RM2.30 per share. Based on its last closing price, this represents a 59% discount to its ex-rights price of RM5.43 per share. After the rights and one-to-two share split, we estimate that Yinson\u2019s basic FY15F EPS of 45 sen will drop to 14.6 sen. Our ex-all diluted SOP will drop from RM10.30 per share to RM3.12 per share. The group\u2019s net gearing of two times as at end-FY14 will drop to 0.4 times as at end-FY15F \u2014 significantly lower than Bumi Armada\u2019s 0.9 times. Yinson will be using 77% of the rights proceeds for debt repayment and working capital purposes. We remain positive on the group, as its lower gearing position allows it to secure up to two projects in 2H14. Despite outperforming the FBM KLCI by 264% over the past year, valuations are still decent at FY15F EV/Ebitda of 9.9 times compared with Bumi Armada\u2019s 11.5 times. Daya Materials BhdTarget price: 48 sen BUY RHB INVESTMENT RESEARCH (April 29): Daya Materials has entered into a share sale agreement with Perfect Propel Sdn Bhd to dispose of 2.4 million ordinary shares in Daya CMT Sdn Bhd \u2014 Daya Materials\u2019 technical services (TS) arm \u2014 for RM18 million. The proposed sale represents a 30% stake in the subsidiary. Cash proceeds amounting to RM18 million would be mainly used for the group\u2019s working capital purposes, operating expenses and repayment of trade and other payables. The transaction is slated to be completed by 2QCY14. We view the disposal favourably, as Perfect Propel has substantial experience in the sector. In fact, this is in line with Daya Materials\u2019 aim to divert more attention and resources to its fledgling upstream O&G venture.  The TS division had been contributing 49% to 55% to PBT between 2009 and 2013 and we believe this is set to change from FY14 as the O&G division starts contributing significantly to the group. Daya Materials\u2019 earnings are expected to improve by 2QFY14.  Public Bank BhdTarget price: RM17.06 HOLD ALLIANCE RESEARCH (April 30): Public Bank announced a proposed RM5 billion rights issue to strengthen its capital position and build up an adequate level of capital buffer in preparation of the forthcoming regulatory capital requirements. The proposed rights issue will lift its capital ratios by three percentage points (ppt) but dilute return on equity (ROE) by two ppt. With the overhang of capital issuance removed, Public Bank can fully focus on growth without distractions. We also expect dividend payout to stop sliding; we have assumed a sustainable dividend payout of 40%. Keeping this ratio up to FY18F, and assuming stable loan growth of 11%, Common Equity Tier 1 ratio should stay healthy at 8%, above Basel III\u2019s requirement. With the rights issue completed, Public Bank\u2019s investors will no longer need to worry about the bank\u2019s inability to meet Basel III requirements. Post rights, Public Bank\u2019s ROE \u2014 estimated at 19% \u2014 is still the highest among Malaysian banks. Bonia Corp BhdTarget price: RM5.45 ADD AFFIN INVESTMENT RESEARCH (April 28): Bonia announced a one-for-one bonus issue. The entitlement date will be determined later, after a special meeting requiring approval from shareholders. Bonia has also proposed a two-for-one share split, after the bonus issue. Backed by Bonia\u2019s healthy earnings growth and ample reserves, we are positive on this announcement. Post-completion of the bonus issue as well as share split, Bonia\u2019s enlarged share base will jump fourfold from 201.6 million shares to 806.3 million shares. Overall, we remain positive on Bonia. We peg the stock at a higher target multiple in view of the corporate exercise, which will boost the stock\u2019s liquidity. We reckon that Bonia\u2019s low liquidity has been an impediment to investors\u2019 seeking to invest in the stock (average six-month volume, 120,000 shares). With an upside potential of 11%, we maintain our \u201cadd\u201d recommendation on Bonia. Key risk to our view is a sharp slowdown in regional consumer spending. Tasek Corp BhdTarget price: RM16.44 HOLD CIMB INVESTMENT RESEARCH (April 29): Tasek\u2019s annualised 1Q14 core net profit formed 100% of our full-year estimate. The results were broadly in line, as we do not expect future quarters to be better, in view of the challenging landscape. The better cement selling prices y-o-y in 1Q, which arrested further margin decline, were expected but are unlikely to be sustainable, as competition is likely to intensify, along with the impact of higher operating costs. The absence of dividends was also expected. Our industry checks show that domestic cement demand is likely to moderate in 2H. This is due to the timing of the implementation of both new building and infrastructure jobs. Following the completion of klia2, other specialised projects such as power plants have yet to take off. The rollout of the RM25 billion MRT 2 project is expected only towards end-2015. Overall cement demand growth could be 4% in 2014 versus 5% to 6% last year. Slower cement demand and domestic oversupply are likely to sustain the competitive landscape.

Holcim Malaysia is currently operating a 1.2 million tonne per annum (tpa) grinding plant in Pasir Gudang, Johor, that leads us to believe a potential asset injection of this unit into Lafarge Malaysia is possible. We do see synergy with the possible merger or acquisition of Holcim Malaysia as Lafarge Malaysia is also operating a 700,000tpa grinding plant in the same area to service clients in Peninsular Malaysia\u2019s southern region.  The company\u2019s integrated plant in Langkawi, Kedah, has been exporting excess clinker at marginal costing. Hence, the transaction may see Lafarge Malaysia channel more clinker to Holcim Malaysia at better margins, as the larger quantity may mean savings in logistics costs. We also think that the market may have overlooked the recent cut in cement rebates, which could be sufficient to cover higher power costs, and that a revision of its list price may be around the corner.  Alam Maritim Resources BhdFair value: RM2.05 BUY AMRESEARCH (April 07): The group plans to invest in an US$80 million modern diving support ship, which will be operated together with a joint-venture partner as part of Alam\u2019s strategy to secure more underwater inspection, repair and maintenance jobs. This vessel will be deployed together with the group\u2019s fleet of remotely operated vehicles. We are positive on the group\u2019s expansion into underwater services as Alam hopes to secure parts of the RM1.2 billion to RM1.5 billion contracts that were earlier extended to Offshoreworks Group, which currently in financial distress. We understand that the group is looking at an equity raising exercise via a potential placement of 10% to 15% as Alam is exploring new upstream ventures such as jackup rigs. As the Alam-Swiber venture failed to secure a package under the Pan-Malaysia transport and installation umbrella concession late last year, the joint venture is actively seeking new projects in the region. Valuations are compelling at a FY14F PER of nine times\u00a0 \u2014 half of the oil and gas sector\u2019s 18 times. Petronas Gas BhdTarget price: RM28.06 BUY HWANGDBS RESEARCH (April 07): Petronas Gas (Petgas) has entered into a new 20-year gas processing and transportation agreement with Petronas. The new terms are more favourable due to an 18% growth in reservation charges (RC). Petronas will provide dry gas for internal consumption at no cost and the increase in RC will more than offset the lower earnings from the performance base structure.  Petronas has approved the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (Rapid) project with an estimate cost of US$16 billion and another US$11 billion for the associated facilities. Petgas is likely to secure a new regas plant under the Rapid project due to its involvement in the Melaka regas plant as the Pengerang plant will be connected to its Peninsular Gas Utilisation network.  Petgas\u2019 share price was flat over the last three months over concerns about the gas agreement renewal and Rapid decision. Our \u201cbuy\u201d rating is premised on solid fundamentals with no fuel and pricing risks; upside from the gas subsidy rationalisation plan; and promising outlook, solid balance sheet and strong parentage.Padini Holdings BhdTarget price: RM2.35 BUY MAYBANKIB RESEARCH (April 08): Padini group will have seven new Brands Outlets (BO) and four new Padini Concept Stores (PCS) by end-FY14 as compared with our original assumption of five new BO and four new PCS. This will add 90,000 to 100,000 sq ft to the group\u2019s total retail space of around 720,000 sq ft as at end-FY13. BO will spearhead earnings growth over the next few years, given its value proposition and bundling strategy that are well accepted by shoppers. Positively, same store sales growth (SSSG) for BO and PCS improved in 2QFY14, taking 1HFY14 SSSG of BO and PCS to +24% and -3.6% respectively. The group is reviewing its pricing strategy to offer more value-added products. We raise our earnings by 2% for FY14 and FY15, taking into account the higher-than-expected new store openings. For FY15 to FY16, we have assumed a flat SSSG for all brands except BO.  Higher valuations are warranted for Padini, given that the domestic consumer sector trades at a 2014 PER of 18.2 times and offers a two-year earnings CAGR of just 10% versus 12.6 times PER and 12% earnings CAGR for Padini. also, Padini\u2019s yields are attractive at 5.9% for 12-month forward.  Sime Darby BhdTarget price: RM10 OUTPERFORMKENANGA RESEARCH (April 08): Sime Darby is selling its 75% stake in Port Dickson Power Bhd (PDP) for RM300 million to Malakoff\u2019s wholly-owned Hypergantic Sdn Bhd (HPS). Note that PDP owns a \u201cpeaking plant\u201d with a 440mw capacity and HPS owns a 25% stake in PDP. The deal is expected to be completed in 2Q14 or 4Q14 of Sime Darby\u2019s financial year. The effective valuation of RM400 million reflects 5.2 times historical PER. Despite the seemingly low valuation, we believe that Sime Darby has made the right decision to offload a non-core asset, considering that PDP has less than two years left on its power purchase agreement. Additionally, the deal is expected to allow management to focus on its other core business. Excluding this deal, Sime Darby\u2019s key earnings driver will still be crude palm oil (CPO), which we expect the average price to be RM2,800 per tonne in 2014. Hence, we believe that Sime Darby\u2019s 2H14 earnings are likely to be higher than that of 1H14 due to the higher CPO prices. The deal should result in short-term positive sentiment for the stock. Tune Ins Holdings BhdTarget price: RM2.31 BUYKAF-SEAGROATT & CAMPBELL SECURITIES (April 07): Tune Ins has received the nod from Thai authorities to own up to 49% in Osotspa Insurance in Thailand. We are optimistic about this development as it will allow the group to capture a bigger underwriting share in online travel insurance in one of AirAsia\u2019s fastest-growing markets. Tune Ins is reportedly negotiating with new potential partners to revive its merger and acquisition (M&A) plans in Indonesia after failing to acquire a 70% stake in PT Batavia Mitratama Insurance last year. Thailand and Indonesia are key markets for the group\u2019s online travel insurance business. We view both developments positively as having local insurance licences in the two countries would enable Tune Ins to underwrite the travel insurance business directly.  The higher net earned premiums coupled with low claims from travel insurance could potentially boost its underwriting profits. In addition to ongoing M&A plans, Tune Ins is also looking at further tie-ups with airlines and travel providers, including Cebu Pacific and Cozmo Travel. Mudajaya Group BhdTarget price: RM3.19 ADDCIMB RESEARCH (April 07): The Edge reported that the RM2 billion job to build the 14.9km Kinrara-Damansara Expressway (Kidex) is now a two-horse race between Mudajaya and Bina Puri Holdings Bhd. The two are the most likely winners among the five companies shortlisted. We still believe that Mudajaya has the best chance of securing the projects due to its good track record of building highways in the Klang Valley, especially elevated ones. The group\u2019s last highway project was the RM2 billion-to-RM3 billion KL-Kuala Selangor Expressway.  Our sources indicated that Kidex is likely to be awarded in 2H14 as construction is scheduled to start by next year. Kidex is the next highway in the government\u2019s plan after the RM5 billion-to-RM6 billion West Coast Expressway. This news supports our view that private sector-driven projects will accelerate this year.  Securing Kidex would more than double Mudajaya\u2019s order book from RM1 billion to RM3 billion. Kidex is an added boost to the potential power plant awards worth an estimated RM400 million to RM500 million for Track 3A and current RM1 billion for Track 3B. Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings BhdFair value: RM4.30 BUYAMRESEARCH (April 07): We maintain our \u201cbuy\u201d call on Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings (MMHE) with an unchanged fair value of RM4.30 per share based on a FY14F PER of 25 times \u2014 a 13% premium to Kencana Petroleum\u2019s peak of 22 times in 2007. We maintain FY14F to FY16F earnings as investigations are ongoing on the cause of the slippage of the Tapis enhanced oil recovery (EOR) structure during its load-out stage. The extent of any earnings impact on MMHE, which was in charge of moving the Tapis R structure on its skids to the vessel, is uncertain at this stage. But 10% of the value of the Tapis R structure may account for 40% of MMHE\u2019s FY14F earnings. Despite this setback, we remain positive on MMHE, given the roll-out of multiple EOR projects involving high-capital expenditure central processing platforms and the recent approval for Petronas\u2019 Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development project in Pengerang, Johor. The stock currently trades at an attractive FY15F PER of 19 times \u2014 24% below SapuraCrest Petroleum\u2019s 2007 peak of 25 times. Pantech Group Holdings BhdFair value: RM1.26 NON-RATEDMIDF RESEARCH (April 08): Recently, Pantech was given the certification by NORSOK (Norwegian safety standards) that will increase its value-add abilities. This will translate into potential future project acquisitions, which will boost company earnings. However, investors should not be deterred with relatively flat projected earnings, stemming from weaker-than-anticipated local demand, as key projects in the recently approved Rapid and other fabrication works are likely to sustain sales. We believe that investors can look forward to a strong dividend payout ratio of 40% to 45%. Pantech is an attractive dividend play stock as yields at current price levels are north of 5% per annum. Apart from being a dividend play, its forward PER remains attractive, ranging from mid-to-high single digit. Although the company suffered sell-downs when it was removed from the Shariah-compliant list, the company aims to be shariah compliant again by end-2014. We are valuing Pantech with a fair value of RM1.26, pegging its EPS for 2015 of 10.5 sen to PER for 2015 of 12 times, which is the highest PER that the stock has achieved over the last five years. Cypark Resources BhdTarget price: RM3.20 OUTPERFORMPUBLIC INVESTMENT BANK (April 08): Fresh off the securing of a construction-related job just about a month ago, Cypark announced its successful tender for the proposed upgrading of the Kajang SILK Highway from the Uniten interchange to the UPM interchange. While the previous one was a one-year RM17.8 million job to construct Phases 1 and 2 of the Fairview International School in Nusajaya, the current one is an 18-month RM34.5 million contract that is expected to be completed by October 2015. Again, this is a welcome development that replenishes its order book for its non-renewable energy segment.  We make no adjustments to our earnings estimates as this also forms part of our replenishment assumption of about RM100 million per annum for the coming years. 1Malaysia Development Bhd\u2019s recent foray into solar power generation, considering its vast other power-related asset holdings, amplifies the case and attractiveness of the renewable energy space, in particular solar. While Cypark has reportedly been approached to partner it in this project, given its know-how, we see the group already thriving on its own. CB Industrial Product Holding BhdTarget price: RM4.48 HOLDHONG LEONG IB RESEARCH (April 08): CBIP received a letter of acceptance from Sime Darby Plantation to design, supply, deliver and commission a 30-tonne per hour Modipalm Continuous Sterilisation palm oil mill in Grand Mount estate, Liberia, worth RM38.5 million. Based on our estimates, the latest contract announcement will boost CBIP\u2019s total unbilled sales for the palm oil mill engineering division to RM524.2 million, equivalent to 1.65 times of the division\u2019s turnover in 2013. This is in line with our view that CBIP is on track to secure more contracts and the strong demand prospects for palm oil mill (which in turn is underpinned by rising plantation landbank). We maintain our \u201chold\u201d call, as we already assumed CBIP would win RM400 million worth of contracts this year in our earnings forecasts. We continue to like CBIP for its strong earnings visibility (arising from the bright demand prospects for CPO mill, witnessed by the strong order book) and balance sheet. We believe further share price upside will likely be capped by its current valuation (year to date, share price has risen by 41.9%). Affin Holdings Bhd Target price: RM4.25 NEUTRALALLIANCE RESEARCH (April 09): Affin announced in January that the group is acquiring Hwang-DBS Investment Bhd, its asset management and futures businesses for RM1.36 billion.  Management has guided that the group is expected to realise synergistic benefits progressively of RM84 million in PBT from 2015 to 2017, while incurring one-off integration costs amounting to RM54 million by 2015 during the exercise.  From 2018 onwards, the group will be able to achieve synergistic benefits of RM43 million PBT per annum. We trim our target price for Affin to RM4.25, applying a steeper 12% discount to our Gordon Growth valuation model. Our 10% discount is to partially reflect the earnings dilution from its equity raising exercise to acquire Hwang-DBS\u2019s selective assets. Our target price implied a one times FY14 price-to-book ratio and a sustainable 9.9% return on equity based on our Gordon Growth valuation model.  We will adjust our earnings estimates accordingly to reflect the dilutive impact from the enlarged share base once the right issue price and number of new shares to be issued are determined.

The expiry date of the exclusivity period, which was March 24, has been extended to June 24. We understand that E&O is still in negotiations with Sime Darby on the terms, including the price of the parcel. Land value at Elmina will increase given the improved connectivity and accessibility to the township upon the completion of the new Damansara-Shah Alam Elevated Expressway in 2016. This will provide a direct connection to Penchala Link/Mont\u2019Kiara and reduce the travelling time to 15 minutes. We maintain our valuation and forecast on E&O for now, which does not incorporate any assumption on the 135 acres of land. We advocate investors to accumulate E&O ahead of the Department of Environment\u2019s approval of the detailed environmental impact assessment study for Seri Tanjung Pinang Phase 2, which is expected to be granted in 2QCY14. Inari Amertron BhdTarget price: RM3.33 BUY AFFIN INVESTMENT BANK RESEARCH (MARCH 25): Inari announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary ISK has been granted approval by the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (Mida) to receive matching 1:1 R&D and training grants under the Domestic Investment Strategic Fund for its fibre-optic products. Under the grant, ISK is entitled to an R&D grant of up to RM9.9 million and a training grant of RM104,000 over a three-year period commencing in 2013. This is a positive development for Inari. The matching grant should ease Inari\u2019s ISK capex requirement, lowering the breakeven point for its operations there. This applies not only to ISK but also to its RF operations in Penang as well as Inari\u2019s 51%-owned subsidiary, Ceedtec, which received a RM9.8 million grant from the Northern Corridor Implementation Authority in 2012 and an RM8 million 1:1 matching grant from Mida in 2013.  Similarly, Inari Technology received a 1:1 matching grant of RM9.2 million from Mida in 2013. The grant income provides potential positive earnings enhancement to our forecasts. MISC BhdTarget price: RM6.32 SELL HONG LEONG INVESTMENT BANK RESEARCH (MARCH 24): MISC has entered into an agreement to sell its 100% stake in MISC Integrated Logistics (MILS) for a cash consideration of RM250 million compared with its unaudited net assets of RM246.5 million as at Dec 31, 2013 (1.01 times book). MILS\u2019 business includes the provision of project logistics and supply chain management. Contributions from MILS over the last two years were relatively immaterial to the group. We are positive on MILS\u2019 disposal, given that MISC would be able to use its resources better and concentrate on its core business segment \u2014 providing shipping services for LNG, petroleum, chemical and offshore. Post MISC exiting the container shipping (liner) business in 1H12, MILS has become a non-core business for MISC. Given that the offered price of RM250 million is higher than our valuation of RM68 million, we raise our target price to RM6.32 from RM6.28. However, as MISC\u2019s share price has overshot our valuation, we advise investors to take profit and downgrade the stock from \u201chold\u201d to \u201csell\u201d. Kian Joo Can Factory BhdTarget price: RM3.30 NEUTRAL PUBLIC INVEST RESEARCH (MARCH 25): Kian Joo has entered into a conditional business sale agreement, properties sale agreement and assets sale agreement with Aspire Insight after the company\u2019s board approved the asset and liability disposal to the latter as initially announced on Nov 26, 2013. This brings the long-drawn-out affair a step nearer to closure, and effectively disregards Toyota Tsusho Corp\u2019s recent letter of intent to acquire a 51% stake in Kian Joo at a higher price of RM3.74 per share.  Aspire\u2019s offer price has been \u201craised\u201d to RM3.36 per share, however, after it recently agreed to waive a term in its initial letter of offer with regard to dividend distributions, essentially including an outstanding dividend declaration of 6.25 sen per share as an addition to its earlier offer of RM3.30 per share. We see this transaction proceeding without major hitches. As we are unlikely to see the higher value we had expected, we lower our call to \u201cneutral\u201d as upside will be limited. We lower the target price to RM3.30 from RM3.52. United Malacca BhdTarget price: RM7.80 HOLD TA SECURITIES RESEARCH (MARCH 24): In 3QFY14, United Malacca reported a second consecutive recovery in earnings, which were in line with our expectations. On a quarterly basis, earnings were boosted by higher realised crude palm oil (CPO) prices and a lower effective tax rate, although the impact was partially offset by a 7.4% contraction in fresh fruit bunch (FFB) harvest. Despite having relatively young estates, FFB yield was negatively impacted by adverse weather conditions. We understand that FY14 FFB harvest is likely to be flat or slightly more on a y-o-y basis. We have assumed lower FFB yield and revised downwards the FY14 production estimate to 2.7% lower y-o-y from 3% growth previously. Mature acreage is only projected to increase by 400ha in FY14. In FY15, however, management estimates 1,000ha will reach maturity, coinciding with the rally in the CPO price. We estimate the total planted area will increase by 3% to 22,300ha. Key risk factors to our earnings forecasts are a sharp rebound in CPO price, better-than-expected FFB growth, and value accretive M&A. S P Setia BhdTarget price: RM3.54 TRADING BUY RHB RESEARCH (MARCH 24): According to news reports, Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar Albukhary has put in an unsolicited proposal to buy a substantial portion of Permodalan Nasional Bhd\u2019s stake in S P Setia. One article indicated that PNB has asked for RM5 per share. Syed Mokhtar\u2019s entry could pave the way for Tan Sri Liew Kee Sin to \u201cre-enter\u201d S P Setia, given that the former had previously sold some tracts to Eco World, in which the latter\u2019s son is the major shareholder. We note, however, that Liew exercised the third and final tranche of his put option on March 21 and is no longer a shareholder of S P Setia. In our view, it may not be easy for Syed Mokhtar to buy a substantial stake at RM5 per share as he will need to fork out RM3.7 billion just to buy a 30% stake. PNB\u2019s high asking price \u2014 which is at a 13% premium to our RNAV per share of RM4.42 \u2014 also indicates that it is not keen to reduce its stake. Glomac BhdTarget price: RM1.15 HOLD TA SECURITIES (MARCH 24): Glomac is acquiring Precious Quest Sdn Bhd (PQSB) for RM22.8 million through a related-party transaction. PQSB holds the rights to develop a piece of leasehold land in Kulaijaya, Johor, measuring 70.5ha, granted by Kumpulan Prasarana Rakyat Johor Sdn Bhd. The parcel is situated near the mixed-use development at Scientex Kulaijaya. Assuming a 70% land efficiency ratio, a 70:30 mix of residential and commercial properties with 10 units per acre, and an average selling price of RM400,000 to RM1 million per unit, the gross development value will range from RM700 million to RM800 million. The group has also acquired a 63-acre parcel in Sungai Buloh for RM23 million. The acquisitions, worth RM45.8 million, will only increase its net gearing to 0.29 times, and should not affect its ability to pay out dividends. We make no change to our FY14 to FY16 earnings forecasts pending further details from management. We maintain our target price of RM1.15, based on seven times CY15 EPS, in line with our target PER for small-cap developers. SapuraKencana Petroleum BhdTarget price: RM5.26 STRONG BUY ALLIANCE RESEARCH (MARCH 25): SapuraKencana\u2019s FY14 results were below our and consensus estimates. Its offshore construction and subsea services (OCSS) segment saw major job completions in 4Q, thus the segment\u2019s earnings were lower than expected.  SapuraKencana\u2019s FY14 revenue grew 21.2% y-o-y to RM8.4 billion. This was largely driven by the purchase of Seadrill\u2019s tender rig fleet, which was completed in 1QFY14. Net profit expanded strongly by 69.4% y-o-y in FY14, again largely driven by the Seadrill rig purchase.  We leave our estimates unchanged for now and expect FY15 to be another year of strong growth with the Newfield acquisition kicking in by 1QFY15 and first Petrobras contract commencing.  We view that earnings from the OCSS segment will normalise as the RM6 billion Pan Malaysian installation (PMI) contract will commence in FY15. We see some downside risk to earnings if the work order flow is slow in the initial stages of the PMI contract or if new vessels delivered do not commence work immediately. Sarawak Oil Palms BhdTarget price: RM6.90 BUY MAYBANK IB RESEARCH (MARCH 24): Investors were pleasantly surprised to learn that Sarawak Oil Palms does not sell its crude palm oil to Wilmar as the planter has its own refinery and exports its palm products directly to buyers in China and India. We expect the company to deliver 13.5% y-o-y growth in fresh fruit bunch output in 2014 or 1.09 million metric ton (MT) \u2014 slightly above the latest guidance of 1.07 million MT.  Fund managers were also surprised to learn that Sarawak Oil Palms is diversifying into property development with two maiden project launches planned in 2014. It aims to unlock the value of its 5,000ha Taniku estates, strategically located near Miri. We are long-term positive on Sarawak Oil Palms as the stock remains undervalued, backed by its 5,000ha of Taniku estates and its young trees (4 to 10 years), which comprise 51% of its total planted area. The latter will be a key earnings growth driver in the next three years as the estates enter prime maturity.P.I.E. Industrial BhdTarget price: RM9.20 TRADING BUY KENANGA RESEARCH (MARCH 25): At the current price of RM8, P.I.E. is trading at 10.4 times FY14E EPS, and we believe that the valuation is still undemanding given the expected double-digit growth in FY14E, management\u2019s proven ability in steering the group, the current tech up cycle, and strong parentage in Foxconn. Management says P.I.E. has won the trust of its US medical device customer as evidenced by the client\u2019s appointment of the group as its turnkey manufacturer for printed circuit board assembly for a portable oxygen concentrator. Revenue contribution to the group is expected to be three times the previous RM500,000 per month, and will commence in 2H2014. The group has started manufacturing touchscreens using advanced technology for one of the world\u2019s giant large-screen players. While the revenue contribution is still minimal for now (about RM1 million per month), we reckon there could be another boost to revenue should the group secure its position as a turnkey manufacturer. Maintain \u201ctrading buy\u201d with a higher target price of RM9.20. Genting Malaysia BhdFair value: RM4.30 HOLD AMRESEARCH (MARCH 24): GenM\u2019s earnings will be unexciting this year as the closure of the outdoor theme park and the high cost of living will affect visitor arrivals and spending at Resorts World Genting. We expect stronger net profit growth in FY15F/FY16F when the new hotel opens in mid-FY15F.  There has been a delay in the development of the casino law in Florida, the US, which may only be passed in 2016. In New York, EPR Properties and Monticello Casino and Raceway have teamed up to propose a US$750 million casino at the old Concorde Hotel, north-west of New York City.  Recall that Monticello is owned by the family trust of Tan Sri Lim Kok Thay. The Gaming Facility Location Board will review and evaluate the submissions and the winning operators will be announced by fall of 2014.  The state has approved four destination gaming resorts cum casinos in upstate New York but there will be no impact on GenM\u2019s Resorts World New York because of a seven-year moratorium on gaming resorts.Berjaya Auto BhdFair value: RM2.55 BUY RHB RESEARCH (MARCH 25): Berjaya Auto is our top sector pick, trading at an undemanding 9.4 times FY15 earnings. Reiterate \u201cbuy\u201d with a RM2.55 fair value, applying an 11.5 times earnings, which is in line with peer target valuations of 9 to 13 times. We encountered strong investor interest at the company\u2019s maiden road show in Hong Kong and believe it has a compelling growth story.  Mazda sales in Malaysia are set to enjoy exponential growth (2013: +45.2% y-o-y) over the next several years, backed by a strong new product pipeline and the local assembly of more models. Mazda Japan is undergoing a renaissance, having recently introduced a slew of highly successful new products centred on the new KODO design language and SkyActiv technologies that have received worldwide acclaim. Five all-new models are set to be introduced between now and 2016. Its new assembly facility within the Inokom plant will be commissioned in April. The higher rate of localisation will yield lower effective excise duty rates, thus enabling Mazda to price its products more competitively.

The stale bulls are concerned that earnings growth may be disappointing, as consumers start tightening their belts, while companies are facing higher costs, as a result of the government\u2019s subsidy cuts. Expectations that Petroliam Nasional Bhd will continue spending on capital expenditure, has helped sustain the bullishness on the local oil and gas sector, which is seen as one of the sweet spots on Bursa Malaysia.  Meanwhile, the construction industry is also a sector to watch, with the government expected to implement a slew of infrastructure projects. Export-oriented sectors, such as glove makers and the electrical and electronics industry, could benefit from the strong US dollar. On the external front, the improved economic conditions in the US and Europe, and the weaker ringgit, may augur well for export-oriented companies. Below are 10 stocks that are worth watching. StemLife Bhd Cash-rich StemLife Bhd attracted some attention, after Singapore-listed Cordlife Group Ltd bought a stake in the largest cord blood banking facility in Malaysia.  Cordlife acquired a 31.82% stake from StemLife directors, Loh Yoon Kwai and Lim Jit Soon, as well as managing director Datuk Low Su-Shing and deputy managing director Datuk Lim Oi Wah. The latter two have ceased to be substantial shareholders of StemLife. Other major shareholders include Tan Sri Vincent Tan\u2019s Berjaya Corp Bhd with a 12.12% stake, Capital Group International Inc with 11.31%, and Emerging Markets Growth Fund with 5.05%. As StemLife is said to have a 60% market share in Malaysia and a 40% stake in StemLife Thailand, the stake acquisition would allow Cordlife to break into new markets and fend off competitors, as demand for such services in the region, grows. Previously trading at a weighted average of 26 sen, StemLife\u2019s share price rose to a three-year peak of 50.5 sen last October (2013), when Cordlife first emerged as a substantial shareholder. On Jan 15, the stock closed at 44.5 sen, translating into a market capitalisation of RM110.1 million.  With cash of up to RM73.7 million as at its 3QFY2013 ended Sept 30, and an issued share capital of 247.5 million, each share is backed by 29.7 sen cash.  Founded in 2001, StemLife has been posting stable earnings, after a bleak period, when the group fell into the red in 2009 and 2010. Since then, the group has recovered, posting a net profit of RM3.1 million in FY2011 and RM5.7 million in FY2012. Earnings per share were 1.9 sen and 3.28 sen, respectively. Gamuda Bhd The stock rallied last year (2013), but many believe that the rally still has legs, because the company is said to be packed with growth catalysts \u2014 not only the contracts it has in hand, but also more construction jobs that it is expected to win. Its coffers will get a big boost, should it sell its 40% stake in water treatment concessionaire, Syarikat Pengeluar Air Sungai Selangor Sdn Bhd. Gamuda is perceived to be on its way to getting the nod for the RM25 billion Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Line 2, by the cabinet. On top of that, it is seen as the front runner for the high-speed rail project.  In May 2013, Gamuda unveiled the MRT Line 2 plans under the KL Transport Master Plan. The 56km MRT Line 2 (also known as the Orbital Line) will stretch from Sungai Buloh to Putrajaya, and will have 35 stations. The plan has gone through feasibility studies and is awaiting cabinet approval, said to come in 1Q2014.  UOB Kay Hian Research expects the contracts to be awarded by mid-2015, and believes that Gamuda can again, take on the personal development planning (PDP) role for MRT Line 2.  \u201c[This] would enable it to earn a 6% PDP fee, or an estimated RM750 million [50% stake]. Given its role in MRT Line 1, Gamuda is also likely to secure the tunnelling packages for Line 2, as it would have significant cost advantage, compared with other players,\u201d says the research house.  Meanwhile, Gamuda has acquired an additional 40% stake in Kesas Expressway, raising its holdings to 70%, in the toll road concessionaire.  In October 2013, Gamuda offered to acquire the remaining 70% stake that it does not own in Kesas, for RM875 million, valuing the concessionaire at about RM1.25 billion. It later upped its offer to RM980 million.  Amcorp Properties Bhd and Permodalan Nasional Bhd, which collectively hold a 40% stake, accepted the offer. But the Selangor State Development Corp, which holds a 30% stake, did not take it up.  Eastern & Oriental Bhd Trading at a weighted average of RM1.95, E&O\u2019s share price jumped from RM1.65 to RM2.20 in 2013. It closed at RM1.94 on Jan 15.  An imminent catalyst for E&O, is its increase in its asset value from the Seri Tanjung Pinang 2 (STP2) land reclamation project.STP2, which covers 760 acres and has high development potential and a lucrative profit margin, is the primary valuation driver. \u201cAs STP2 will be reclaimed in two phases, it appears unlikely that E&O would need to do a rights issue,\u201d says AmResearch, in a note. It adds that E&O is also committed to maintaining its 30% dividend policy.  With Sime Darby Bhd as its parent company, with a 32% stake, E&O has various opportunities to tap the vast landbank of its major shareholder. E&O has just started to access Sime Darby\u2019s landbank. It recently entered into a memorandum of agreement to acquire 135 acres of prime residential land, said to be earmarked for a lifestyle and wellness-themed project, in Sime Darby\u2019s City of Elmina\u00a0 development, located along the Guthrie Corridor Expressway.  E&O also has strong pre-sales in the pipeline, comprising several major projects, such as Avira Wellness Resort in Iskandar Malaysia and Princess House redevelopment in London. \u201cWe expect the initial 200 units of linked houses [at Avira Wellness Resort] to be fully taken up. Additional sales of RM200 million, will be easily achieved,\u201d says AmResearch.  The research house reasons that if this materialises, it would provide a significant boost to the Avira project, which has a gross development value of more than RM3 billion. The positive outlook for Avira, is because of the expected strong reception for its phase 1, which comprises 208 terraced houses.  E&O\u2019s healthy balance sheet is reflected in its net gearing of 33%, as at its 1QFY2014. The group also has unbilled sales of RM550 million, as at end-August.  Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd Big things are expected of this mid-cap outfit, which in the week prior to Jan 20, alone, has seen its share price jump more than 12%, to reach a new high of RM2.58 at Jan 16\u2019s close. Its market capitalisation was RM1.09 billion. In 2013, Muhibbah received a fabrication licence from Petroliam Nasional Bhd, which enables it to participate in major offshore and onshore fabrication works, for Petronas and other major oil companies in Malaysia. This sent its share price soaring more than 83%, over the span of a month, to RM2.60 on July 25. But the stock is still on analysts\u2019 recommendation list, with a target price of RM3 or higher. Muhibbah has an integrated business model that includes construction, ship building and crane manufacturing. It is now poised to become a strong proxy to the oil and gas sector. CIMB Research believes that Muhibbah\u2019s turnaround prospects look exciting, backed by Petronas\u2019 RM60 billion annual capex, which should benefit the group\u2019s crane and shipyard divisions. All eyes are on Petronas\u2019 refinery and petrochemicals integrated development project in Pengerang, Johor, which should see a final investment decision in April. CIMB Research says that Muhibbah\u2019s opportunities in the project, remain intact. Muhibbah also has a 62% stake in Favelle Favco Bhd \u2014 a crane operator. Favelle Favco entered the China market in early 2012, and hopes to deliver up to 15 cranes a year, from its operations in China, which could amount to RM100 million a year. Muhibbah now has an order book of RM2.1 billion. The company pulled itself out of the red in 2013, and reported a net profit of RM60.64 million, for nine months ended Sept 30 \u2014 up 15% from the year before. Its earnings per share stood at 4.86 sen. Muhibbah is currently sitting on cash of some RM310.68 million, but has borrowings amounting to RM234.43 million.Brahim\u2019s Holdings Bhd The halal in-flight caterer has done well in terms of share price, having gained more than 198% in 2013, but analysts tracking the stock still see upside in the stock. It achieved a new high of RM2.24 on Jan 9, 2014, following news of a collaboration with All Nippon Airways (ANA). The stock closed at RM2.03 on Jan 16, giving it a market capitalisation of RM457.86 million. Just over a week prior to Jan 20, the company announced a collaboration agreement with ANA, for the provision of in-flight halal meals to ANA\u2019s Asian routes and Middle Eastern airlines, at Haneda and Narita airports. It is said that the partnership could provide a gross contribution of about RM5 million in the first year, and this could double in the second year. This will allow Brahim\u2019s to move away from its dependence on Kuala Lumpur International Airport\u2019s traffic flow, and thus, reduce concentration risk of its earnings base, according to Alliance Research. The research house has a \u201cstrong buy\u201d on the stock, and recently raised its target price to RM2.67. Hong Leong Investment Bank Research has a \u201cbuy\u201d call on Brahim\u2019s, with a target price of RM2.64. For the nine months ended Sept 30, 2013, Brahim\u2019s announced a net profit of RM10.19 million, or 4.74 sen per share, up from RM3.86 million, or 1.96 sen, a year ago. Brahim\u2019s also operates restaurants and cafes in KLIA and the low-cost carrier terminal, but the bulk of its earnings comes from in-flight catering for Malaysian Airline System Bhd (MAS). The national carrier accounts for 80% of Brahim\u2019s revenue. It currently provides in-flight meals to 37 airlines. Apart from the tie-up with ANA, Brahim\u2019s is also expected to see an earnings boost, when klia2 opens in May. The company is beginning to diversify its business, as it is building sugar refineries in Sarawak and Sabah, which should commence production by 2015. Another draw would be the fact that it is a well-managed company, and will benefit from a rise in passenger traffic during Visit Malaysia Year 2014, say analysts.Ho Hup Construction Co Bhd  Ho Hup Construction Co, currently a PN17 company, sits on a clean balance sheet with low borrowings, after a cash call.  Having reported profits for four consecutive quarters, the company is qualified to seek an upliftment from its PN17 status, which may happen this year. Getting out of PN17 status would be a major boost for Ho Hup, as it would be able to compete for tenders on an equal footing with other bidders. Ho Hup has had to rely on joint-venture partners, to win tenders, or had to play a sub-contractor\u2019s role, throughout its time as a PN17 company. Post-restructuring, the company may receive a fresh inflow of capital, which will enable it to undertake landbanking activities to boost its property development business. The company is making inroads into property development, with its 60 acres of prime land in Bukit Jalil.  According to Kenanga Research, the freehold commercial land is the main driver of Ho Hup\u2019s future earnings. The company has sole development rights to 10 acres of the tract, while the rest is part of a joint development (JD) between Ho Hup and Malton Bhd. A revised master plan for the JD land, has been submitted for approval. With the revised GDV estimated at more than RM4 billion, compared with RM2.1 billion currently, Ho Hup\u2019s entitlement may rise to close to RM500 million. \u201cThe realised net asset value of Ho Hup, could be between RM1.55 and RM2.55 per share, or\u00a0RM2.05 on average, as the asking prices for land in Bukit Jalil are between RM250 and RM400 psf,\u201d says Kenanga Research. Ho Hup is trading at a market capitalisation of about RM155 million.  Supermax Corp Bhd Prospects look bright for the glove industry. The weak ringgit is expected to be the tailwind for glove makers, such as Supermax Corp Bhd.  Furthermore, Supermax\u2019s capacity expansion plans for 2014, could augur well for its earnings, as higher output would help ease its bottleneck.  Taking the new capacity into account, analysts foresee mid-teen earnings growth in the next two years.  Supermax is expecting to commence commercial operations of its two new plants, by the end of 1QFY2014.\u00a0Given the strong demand for nitrile gloves, the company is seen to be facing a two-month oversold position, according to Kenanga Research. The stock has also seen the re-emergence of Employees Provident Fund as a substantial shareholder, with a 5.5% stake. The glove maker\u2019s share price has rallied since end-2013, doubling to a three-year high of RM3.01 on Jan 9, before retreating to RM2.85 on Jan 16.  As the stock is trading at 12 times FY2014 earnings, compared with the 15 times of its peer Kossan, analysts expect the valuation gap to narrow with time. \u201cWe believe (that) the valuation gap will narrow, considering that\u00a0Supermax\u2019s capacity and net profits are at levels similar to Kossan\u2019s,\u201d said Kenanga Research. Supermax\u2019s big plans for its Glove City and Supermax Business Park, saw the company cough out RM1.3 billion, over 11 years. The first phase of Glove City, comprising six large plants with a total capacity of 24.6 billion pieces, is expected to be ready in 1HFY2015. An estimated RM95 million was allocated for capital expenditure. Supermax Business Park is expected to be developed in 2HFY2014. The project will be located at a new site, measuring 100 acres. An integrated glove manufacturing complex (IGMC) will take up 60 acres. Capex for the first phase of the IGMC, is expected to be at RM70 million. \u201cWe are not overly concerned about funding, considering that Supermax has a net gearing of 12% as at Sept 30, 2013, and operating cash flow, which we forecast, will average RM115 million per annum,\u201d Kenanga Research said in a note. It noted that additional profits from the sale of factories built for the supporting businesses, could be ploughed back into the capex for the IGMC. Tenaga Nasional Bhd Tenaga Nasional Bhd\u2019s share price has soared, following the tariff hike. The stock shot up close to 21% over a month, hitting an all-time high of RM11.80 on Jan 8. The tariff hike is expected to lift the utility group\u2019s earnings. On top of that, TNB will no longer need to shoulder any rise in fuel cost, as the government has in place, a fuel pass-through mechanism. Its expenditure will come down substantially, going forward.  Maybank Investment Bank Research says, the market consensus has yet to incorporate the full earnings accretion from the tariff hike, despite the share price rally. It also points out that the reduced earnings risk has not been fully priced in.  Effective Jan 1, the tariff will go up 14.9% in Peninsular Malaysia and 16.9% in Sabah, with the implementation of the incentive-based regulation mechanism. The stock closed at RM11.46 on Jan 16, giving it a market capitalisation of RM64.68 billion. Of the analysts covering the stock, AmResearch has the highest target price of RM14.90. Some may find it pricey, noting that the stock climbed from RM7 level, early last year (2013). However, it is a component stock that is on many watch lists, especially institutional funds, waiting to bargain-hunt on its share price weakness.  AmResearch says that TNB maintains its near-monopoly status in the transmission and distribution of electricity in Peninsular Malaysia, and thus, has a natural advantage in competitive bids for new power generation. This year, the Energy Commission is expected to call a tender for two gas-fired power plants under Track 4A and Track 4B, with a total capacity of 2,000mw. This follows the competitive bid for the RM11 billion Project 3B, for which YTL Power International Bhd has been tipped as the front runner. AmResearch notes that the competitive bidding process to build new power plants, will drive down TNB\u2019s cost structure. AmResearch estimates TNB\u2019s net profit to grow to RM4.9 billion, or 87.6 sen per share, for the financial year ending Aug 31, 2014.  Petra Energy Bhd Increasing focus on domestic oil and gas production by enhancing oil recovery, developing small fields and increasing exploration activities to locate new fields, are seen to bode well for Petra Energy Group. The risk service contract (RSC), in which Petra Energy has a 30% stake, and partner,\u00a0Coastal Energy KBM Sdn Bhd,\u00a0holds 70% interest, saw its first oil output from the Kapal, Banag and Meranti (KBM) cluster fields. The KBM cluster, operated by Coastal Energy, has been developed since June 2012. The first oil production at the KBM cluster, is a major milestone for the consortium. Some industry players say that this could possibly pave way for it to secure more RSCs in the future.  The stock has been climbing, but it has underperformed, compared with its peers.  Although Petra Energy posted a net loss of RM4.1 million in 3QFY2013 ended Sept 30, analysts remain optimistic, as the company continues to work on a wide range of substantive plans to improve its performance, particularly in the subsea business. The brown field service provider acknowledges that this year is a little slow-moving, but is nonetheless looking ahead to the year\u2019s final quarter, as it is continuously looking to enhance its capabilities to expand into relevant market sectors. Petra Energy attributes its 3QFY13 loss to lower contribution from its integrated brown field maintenance and engineering services segment. The group saw a 28% y-o-y decline in revenue to RM115 million, from RM159.8 million a year ago. However, this is expected to\u00a0improve.  Besides development and production from the KBM cluster, the group is eyeing support services that could add to its bottom line. These include maintenance activities, such as marine support and operations. The group\u2019s order book currently stands at RM3 billion, while the tender book is worth RM1.9 billion. Land & General Bhd With mid-cap property stocks being all the rage recently, Land & General Bhd (L&G) could also be to investors\u2019 liking, especially with its landbank that is deemed undervalued. L&G had a renounceable rights issue of irredeemable convertible unsecured loan stocks, last year. The stock began to gain momentum, soon after the rights issue, which picked up in December last year. Since then, the stock has risen 27.03%, to close at 47 sen on Jan 16. L&G has been growing its bottom line in double digits, for the past four financial years, save for FY2011. In 9MFY2014 alone, the property developer\u2019s net profit, more-than-tripled to RM33.52 million, on the back of RM229.96 million in revenue. \u201cL&G\u2019s name carries the baggage of its past, as the huge conglomerate was saddled with high debts, during the Asian financial crisis of 1997. This hindered the take-up for its first new launch in 2009 \u2014 [email\u00a0protected] Sri Damansara \u2014 which L&G had to work hard to prove itself,\u201d said HwangDBS Vickers Research, in a December note. \u201cDemand for its projects has gradually improved, as seen from the more-than 90% sales for [email\u00a0protected] and Damansara Foresta Phase 1.\u201d  The research house says that L&G\u2019s landbank is grossly undervalued. It adds that the property developer\u2019s net book value for its landbank for future development, is RM111.8 million. However, the market value for L&G\u2019s landbank came to a total of RM890.8 million. A prime example would be the Bandar Sri Damansara clubhouse, which had a net book value of RM2 psf, against the market value of RM250 psf. HwangDBS notes that L&G has unbilled sales of RM800 million, which is four times greater than the revenue generated by the company\u2019s property development segment in FY2013. This does not include its future launches, that have a total gross development value of RM1.5 billion.

Today, Russia shipped more troops and armour into Crimea and repeated its threat to invade other parts of Ukraine, showing no sign of listening to Western pleas to back off from the confrontation, reported Reuters. Russia's stock markets tumbled before pro-Moscow authorities in Crimea hold a vote to join Russia, a move all but certain to lead to U.S. and EU sanctions on Monday.

Elaborating, HLIB said Sime Darby's 1HFY14 core net profit declined 24.5% year-on-year to RM1.27 billion due to weaker contribution from its plantation and motor divisions. It noted that lower contribution from the plantation division was due to \u201ca 2% decline in realised CPO (crude palm oil) price, lower FFB output and lower CPO sales volume\u201d which resulted in lower operating profit from the division. Meanwhile, the motor division was affected by weak demand in Singapore and the economic slowdown in Thailand.
